</p>
<p>
The Fuel Economy score is distinct by comparing the estimated collective mpg for every car in the lineup to the prearranged competitive set. If there are no EPA figures available, the manufacturer's estimations of mpg are used instead.

A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver opinion display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may along with use a rotary knob, touchpad, or additional manage method to ham it up a non-touchscreen display. popular technologies next wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are unlimited supplementary points.
</p>
<p>

A other lessening is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the urge on chair or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
The score for cargo freshen and storage is sure by the reviewer's evaluation of the vehicle's large and small cargo areas (as capably as small-item storage), as well as how effectively they fulfill their meant functions and make efficient use of understandable space.
