</p>
<p>
The Fuel Economy score is certain by comparing the estimated total mpg for all car in the lineup to the agreed competitive set. If there are no EPA figures available, the manufacturer's estimations of mpg are used instead.

A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver recommendation display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may furthermore use a rotary knob, touchpad, or supplementary manage method to play a non-touchscreen display. popular technologies subsequent to wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are firm further points.
</p>
<p>
The comfort, ergonomics, and general interior mood of the vehicle, as skillfully as the efficient use of space, are all taken into account considering determining the Comfort & Room score.

A added point is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the assist seat or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
