    </p>
    <h2>Overall: The Atlanta Food Truck Park Opens in West Midtown Atlanta food, Food</h2>
    <p>
A vehicle's handling, braking, acceleration, ride quality, and further qualitative performance metrics including horsepower, torque, zero-to-60 time, and summit promptness are every evaluated subjectively to determine the work score. The carrying out of trucks and SUVs to tow is along with taken into account.

<p>
The Fuel Economy score is definite by comparing the estimated total mpg for all car in the lineup to the agreed competitive set. If there are no EPA figures available, the manufacturer's estimations of mpg are used instead. If the competitor set does not additionally find the money for hybrid or PHEV models, hybrid and plug-in electric variations within a lineup that considerably lowers their sum average will not be included in the comparison. Based upon the comparative mile per gallon equivalent, or MPGe, and the kilowatts consumed per 100 miles, final electric vehicles will be scored.

A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver opinion display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may in addition to use a rotary knob, touchpad, or other govern method to be in a non-touchscreen display. well-liked technologies subsequent to wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are perfect further points.
</p>

A further reduction is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the back up seat or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
The score for cargo proclaim and storage is positive by the reviewer's review of the vehicle's large and small cargo areas (as capably as small-item storage), as without difficulty as how effectively they fulfill their meant functions and make efficient use of open space. Reviewers as well as take into account versatile loading features and creative storage solutions. Additionally, points are pure based on how the rear cargo hold or trunk's measurements relate to the fixed competitive set. A further tapering off is awarded to vehicles once the best cargo or trunk broadcast in their segment.
</p>
