</p>
<p>
The Fuel Economy score is distinct by comparing the estimated whole mpg for every car in the lineup to the agreed competitive set. If there are no EPA figures available, the manufacturer's estimations of mpg are used instead.

A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver guidance display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may next use a rotary knob, touchpad, or other rule method to appear in a non-touchscreen display. popular technologies subsequently wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are pure extra points.

Reviewers then receive into account versatile loading features and creative storage solutions. Additionally, points are unmovable based on how the rear cargo preserve or trunk's measurements relate to the selected competitive set.
