A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver opinion display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may furthermore use a rotary knob, touchpad, or new run method to play a non-touchscreen display. popular technologies taking into consideration wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are unconditional supplementary points.
</p>
<p>

Rear chair legroom measurement and comparison to the specified competitive set are next unchangeable points. A bonus reduction is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the put up to seat or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
