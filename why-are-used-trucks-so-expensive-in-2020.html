</p>
<p>
The Fuel Economy score is sure by comparing the estimated total mpg for all car in the lineup to the selected competitive set. If there are no EPA figures available, the manufacturer's estimations of mpg are used instead.

A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver information display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may as well as use a rotary knob, touchpad, or other control method to play a non-touchscreen display. popular technologies later wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are unadulterated new points.
</p>
<p>
The comfort, ergonomics, and general interior tone of the vehicle, as capably as the efficient use of space, are all taken into account bearing in mind determining the Comfort & Room score. Rear seat legroom measurement and comparison to the specified competitive set are next perfect points. A added reduction is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the put up to chair or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>

Additionally, points are perfect based on how the rear cargo sustain or trunk's measurements relate to the prearranged competitive set.
