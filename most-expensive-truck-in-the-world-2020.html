A other reduction is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the assist seat or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
The score for cargo melody and storage is distinct by the reviewer's review of the vehicle's large and little cargo areas (as skillfully as small-item storage), as capably as how effectively they fulfill their designed functions and make efficient use of easily reached space.
