<p>
The Fuel Economy score is positive by comparing the estimated amassed mpg for all car in the lineup to the fixed competitive set. If there are no EPA figures available, the manufacturer's estimations of mpg are used instead. If the competitor set does not additionally manage to pay for hybrid or PHEV models, hybrid and plug-in electric variations within a lineup that considerably lowers their sum average will not be included in the comparison. Based upon the comparative mile per gallon equivalent, or MPGe, and the kilowatts consumed per 100 miles, resolved electric vehicles will be scored.
</p>
<p>

A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver suggestion display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may then use a rotary knob, touchpad, or other control method to do its stuff a non-touchscreen display. popular technologies taking into consideration wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are given additional points.
</p>
<p>

A bonus narrowing is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the back seat or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
The score for cargo manner and storage is determined by the reviewer's evaluation of the vehicle's large and little cargo areas (as with ease as small-item storage), as with ease as how effectively they fulfill their designed functions and create efficient use of affable space. Reviewers also agree to into account versatile loading features and creative storage solutions. Additionally, points are firm based on how the rear cargo preserve or trunk's measurements relate to the fixed competitive set.
