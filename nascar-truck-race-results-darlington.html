    <p>
A vehicle's handling, braking, acceleration, ride quality, and additional qualitative work metrics including horsepower, torque, zero-to-60 time, and top rapidity are every evaluated subjectively to determine the statute score.

A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver instruction display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may along with use a rotary knob, touchpad, or extra control method to feat a non-touchscreen display. well-liked technologies next wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are solution further points.
</p>
<p>

A supplementary tapering off is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the support chair or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
