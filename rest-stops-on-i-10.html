    <h2>Overall: FL I10 Okaloosa County Rest Area Eastbound MM 58 Florida Rest Areas</h2>
    <p>
A vehicle's handling, braking, acceleration, ride quality, and other qualitative feign metrics including horsepower, torque, zero-to-60 time, and summit speed are every evaluated subjectively to determine the take effect score. The feat of trucks and SUVs to tow is furthermore taken into account. The vehicles' piece of legislation is contrasted once the specified competitive set. similar to reviewing a vehicle though it is visceral driven, experts see for characteristics that are in pedigree gone both consumer and manufacturer expectations.
</p>
<p>
The Fuel Economy score is determined by comparing the estimated entire sum mpg for every car in the lineup to the fixed competitive set. If there are no EPA figures available, the manufacturer's estimations of mpg are used instead. If the competitor set does not additionally pay for hybrid or PHEV models, hybrid and plug-in electric variations within a lineup that considerably lowers their sum average will not be included in the comparison. Based on the comparative mile per gallon equivalent, or MPGe, and the kilowatts consumed per 100 miles, answer electric vehicles will be scored.
</p>
<p>
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety wreck exam data form the basis of the Safety score. Neither agency has yet to rate a vehicle, hence it receives no points. Points answer for specific cutting-edge driver-assistance safety technologies that arrive as standard upon the lowest trim are as a consequence factored into the safety ranking. Forbes Wheels believes that the once nine safety features must be included as ration of the tolerable offering: passage departure warning, dispatch emergency automatic braking, automatic high beams, blind spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, adaptive cruise control, and one of its higher-level variants, passage keeping opinion or passageway centering. For vehicles to get points, they must put in at least four of them in their regular offering. Vehicles that offer a Level 2 self-driving system, (a concentration of adaptive cruise run and passageway centering) are eligible for a supplementary point.
</p>
<p>
Based upon points unadulterated for clear elements included as all right equipment upon the base trim, the infotainment score is calculated. positive characteristics that are becoming more and more well-liked have been adopted by both premium and layer publicize manufacturers, according to Forbes Wheels. A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver guidance display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may then use a rotary knob, touchpad, or extra manage method to affect a non-touchscreen display. well-liked technologies behind wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are unadulterated further points.
</p>
<p>
The comfort, ergonomics, and general interior environment of the vehicle, as without difficulty as the efficient use of space, are every taken into account as soon as determining the Comfort & Room score. Rear seat legroom measurement and comparison to the specified competitive set are in addition to answer points. A supplementary dwindling is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the help chair or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
The score for cargo circulate and storage is certain by the reviewer's review of the vehicle's large and small cargo areas (as competently as small-item storage), as competently as how effectively they fulfill their meant functions and make efficient use of straightforward space. Reviewers next consent into account versatile loading features and creative storage solutions. Additionally, points are pure based on how the rear cargo keep or trunk's measurements relate to the agreed competitive set. A other point is awarded to vehicles similar to the best cargo or trunk tell in their segment.
</p>
<p>
The Styling score is a judgment of a vehicle's overall interior and exterior styling and design. Reviewers then believe into account how the interior is organized and how without difficulty the design supports the purpose. A factor is the build quality.</p>
