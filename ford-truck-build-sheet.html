    <h2>Overall: Original Build Sheet Ford F150 Forum Community of Ford Truck Fans</h2>
    <p>
A vehicle's handling, braking, acceleration, ride quality, and supplementary qualitative exploit metrics including horsepower, torque, zero-to-60 time, and summit enthusiasm are all evaluated subjectively to determine the play in score. The ability of trucks and SUVs to tow is in addition to taken into account. The vehicles' deed is contrasted taking into account the specified competitive set. when reviewing a vehicle while it is swine driven, experts see for characteristics that are in pedigree in the same way as both consumer and manufacturer expectations.
</p>
<p>
The Fuel Economy score is positive by comparing the estimated sum up mpg for all car in the lineup to the selected competitive set. If there are no EPA figures available, the manufacturer's estimations of mpg are used instead. If the competitor set does not additionally present hybrid or PHEV models, hybrid and plug-in electric variations within a lineup that considerably lowers their sum average will not be included in the comparison. Based on the comparative mile per gallon equivalent, or MPGe, and the kilowatts consumed per 100 miles, pure electric vehicles will be scored.
</p>
<p>
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crash test data form the basis of the Safety score. Neither agency has yet to rate a vehicle, hence it receives no points. Points unmovable for specific cutting-edge driver-assistance safety technologies that arrive as welcome upon the lowest trim are then factored into the safety ranking. Forbes Wheels believes that the when nine safety features must be included as portion of the enjoyable offering: alleyway departure warning, speak to emergency automatic braking, automatic high beams, blind spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, adaptive cruise control, and one of its higher-level variants, path keeping guidance or passage centering. For vehicles to gain points, they must include at least four of them in their regular offering. Vehicles that manage to pay for a Level 2 self-driving system, (a engagement of adaptive cruise rule and lane centering) are eligible for a added point.
</p>
<p>
Based upon points final for certain elements included as satisfactory equipment on the base trim, the infotainment score is calculated. determined characteristics that are becoming more and more popular have been adopted by both premium and addition puff manufacturers, according to Forbes Wheels. A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver recommendation display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may as a consequence use a rotary knob, touchpad, or further rule method to work a non-touchscreen display. well-liked technologies later than wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are solution additional points.
</p>
<p>
The comfort, ergonomics, and general interior air of the vehicle, as without difficulty as the efficient use of space, are all taken into account later than determining the Comfort & Room score. Rear chair legroom measurement and comparison to the specified competitive set are plus unmodified points. A further reduction is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the support seat or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
The score for cargo heavens and storage is certain by the reviewer's review of the vehicle's large and small cargo areas (as capably as small-item storage), as with ease as how effectively they fulfill their intended functions and make efficient use of comprehensible space. Reviewers as a consequence say yes into account versatile loading features and creative storage solutions. Additionally, points are fixed idea based upon how the rear cargo withhold or trunk's measurements relate to the fixed competitive set. A extra tapering off is awarded to vehicles like the best cargo or trunk impression in their segment.
</p>
<p>
The Styling score is a judgment of a vehicle's overall interior and exterior styling and design. Reviewers as a consequence take into account how the interior is organized and how well the design supports the purpose. A factor is the build quality.</p>
