<p>
The Fuel Economy score is sure by comparing the estimated collective mpg for all car in the lineup to the fixed competitive set. If there are no EPA figures available, the manufacturer's estimations of mpg are used instead.

A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver recommendation display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may plus use a rotary knob, touchpad, or further control method to operate a non-touchscreen display. well-liked technologies once wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are definite supplementary points.
</p>
<p>

A added dwindling is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the back seat or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
The score for cargo expose and storage is definite by the reviewer's review of the vehicle's large and small cargo areas (as well as small-item storage), as competently as how effectively they fulfill their meant functions and create efficient use of comprehensible space. Reviewers next consent into account versatile loading features and creative storage solutions. Additionally, points are given based on how the rear cargo retain or trunk's measurements relate to the prearranged competitive set.
