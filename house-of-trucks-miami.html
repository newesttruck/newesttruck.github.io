</p>
<p>
The Fuel Economy score is sure by comparing the estimated sum up mpg for every car in the lineup to the agreed competitive set. If there are no EPA figures available, the manufacturer's estimations of mpg are used instead.

</p>
<p>
Based on points total for positive elements included as usual equipment on the base trim, the infotainment score is calculated. certain characteristics that are becoming more and more popular have been adopted by both premium and deposit promote manufacturers, according to Forbes Wheels. A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver recommendation display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may then use a rotary knob, touchpad, or extra run method to do its stuff a non-touchscreen display. well-liked technologies as soon as wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are unmodified new points.
</p>
<p>
