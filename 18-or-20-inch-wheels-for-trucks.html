                    <p align="justify">Pay later or over time with affirm. I had ordered the truck with 18 inch lt tires, living in rural ontario extra sidewall is always nice to have. Shop 18 inch truck wheels rims. My personal preference is that 20&#039;s look better. 18 inch wheels &amp; rims.</p>

                    <p align="justify">Are 20 inch wheels and tires better for handling heavy loads? Is the firmer ride on rough surfaces (both paved and not) work the added lateral stability? 120 or higher is good. There is really no benefit in going from 18 inch to 20 inch aside from nicer aesthetics. We have an &#039;18 f150 with the stock 20 wheels.</p>

As i&#039;ve been doing some shopping for a new truck, i&#039;ve noticed all the trucks seem to come with standard 18 wheels with optional 20 wheels. The gcwr varies depending on the model configuration of the truck. 80 is way to rough. They are rated for 3740 pounds each.</p>

                    <p align="justify">With 18&#039;s since there will be more sidewall on the tire the ride can feel a little smoother, and in some instances depending on tire type, make, and model the costs of 18&#039;s could be cheaper. Depends on which looks better to you. Artie, reread what maverick had to say, the larger the diameter of the wheel, the lower the.</p>

                    <p align="justify">For looks it is personal preference. My current rig has 16 wheels, is there some sort of mechanical advantage to be gained with a larger wheel? You can make a sidewall stiffer by making it heavier (lt) or shorter (20). The 20 wheel trucks have a higher gcwr on max tow because of reduced sidewall flex. Ford has to meet.</p>
