                    <p align="justify">I guess i should start looking at chrome rims. Those wheel brands have been the most common choice for truck owners (replacing the old chrome wheels finish). Truck freight and oversize charges still apply unless otherwise noted, and can only be shipped to the lower 48 states. We know you care intensely about your vehicle. From $738.00 kmc xd series.</p>

                    <p align="justify">Mht fuel offroad maverick d260 chrome with gloss black lip wheels. I&#039;d prob say a slick 95% of the time chrome or polished is the way to go. Save 5% on all chrome and polished truck wheels and rims, plus get free shipping and even bigger savings on more wheels! I guess i should start looking at chrome rims. That.</p>
