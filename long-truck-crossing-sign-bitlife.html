<p>
The Fuel Economy score is sure by comparing the estimated collection mpg for every car in the lineup to the selected competitive set. If there are no EPA figures available, the manufacturer's estimations of mpg are used instead. If the competitor set does not additionally manage to pay for hybrid or PHEV models, hybrid and plug-in electric variations within a lineup that considerably lowers their sum average will not be included in the comparison.

A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver guidance display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may then use a rotary knob, touchpad, or supplementary manage method to play in a non-touchscreen display. well-liked technologies afterward wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are resolution further points.
</p>
<p>

Rear seat legroom measurement and comparison to the specified competitive set are as a consequence pure points. A extra reduction is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the urge on chair or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
The score for cargo tone and storage is positive by the reviewer's evaluation of the vehicle's large and little cargo areas (as capably as small-item storage), as capably as how effectively they fulfill their intended functions and create efficient use of open space. Reviewers after that say you will into account versatile loading features and creative storage solutions.
