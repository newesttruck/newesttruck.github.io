A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver suggestion display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may also use a rotary knob, touchpad, or other manage method to pretense a non-touchscreen display. well-liked technologies with wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are resolution new points.
