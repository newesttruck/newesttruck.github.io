<p>
The Fuel Economy score is distinct by comparing the estimated combination mpg for every car in the lineup to the fixed competitive set. If there are no EPA figures available, the manufacturer's estimations of mpg are used instead.

A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver opinion display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may then use a rotary knob, touchpad, or other govern method to accomplish a non-touchscreen display. well-liked technologies taking into consideration wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are truth extra points.

Rear seat legroom measurement and comparison to the specified competitive set are next unquestionable points. A bonus point is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the assist chair or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
The score for cargo space and storage is distinct by the reviewer's review of the vehicle's large and little cargo areas (as without difficulty as small-item storage), as well as how effectively they fulfill their expected functions and make efficient use of handy space. Reviewers as a consequence admit into account versatile loading features and creative storage solutions. Additionally, points are fixed idea based on how the rear cargo keep or trunk's measurements relate to the fixed competitive set. A extra dwindling is awarded to vehicles when the best cargo or trunk circulate in their segment.
