<p>
The Fuel Economy score is determined by comparing the estimated accumulate mpg for every car in the lineup to the chosen competitive set. If there are no EPA figures available, the manufacturer's estimations of mpg are used instead.

A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver instruction display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may along with use a rotary knob, touchpad, or supplementary govern method to operate a non-touchscreen display. popular technologies following wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are perfect supplementary points.
</p>
