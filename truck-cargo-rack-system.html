<p>
The Fuel Economy score is distinct by comparing the estimated total mpg for every car in the lineup to the chosen competitive set. If there are no EPA figures available, the manufacturer's estimations of mpg are used instead.

A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver suggestion display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may afterward use a rotary knob, touchpad, or supplementary rule method to appear in a non-touchscreen display. popular technologies considering wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are firm other points.
</p>

Rear seat legroom measurement and comparison to the specified competitive set are furthermore unchangeable points. A bonus lessening is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the assist chair or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>

Additionally, points are total based upon how the rear cargo retain or trunk's measurements relate to the chosen competitive set. A added dwindling is awarded to vehicles subsequent to the best cargo or trunk ventilate in their segment.
