</p>
<p>
The Fuel Economy score is clear by comparing the estimated total mpg for every car in the lineup to the prearranged competitive set. If there are no EPA figures available, the manufacturer's estimations of mpg are used instead. If the competitor set does not additionally find the money for hybrid or PHEV models, hybrid and plug-in electric variations within a lineup that considerably lowers their sum average will not be included in the comparison. Based on the comparative mile per gallon equivalent, or MPGe, and the kilowatts consumed per 100 miles, pure electric vehicles will be scored.

A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver instruction display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may then use a rotary knob, touchpad, or additional direct method to put-on a non-touchscreen display. well-liked technologies later wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are resolved further points.
</p>
<p>

Rear chair legroom measurement and comparison to the specified competitive set are then perfect points. A added reduction is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the put up to chair or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
The score for cargo look and storage is positive by the reviewer's evaluation of the vehicle's large and little cargo areas (as skillfully as small-item storage), as well as how effectively they fulfill their designed functions and make efficient use of clear space. Reviewers moreover say you will into account versatile loading features and creative storage solutions. Additionally, points are solution based upon how the rear cargo retain or trunk's measurements relate to the fixed competitive set.
