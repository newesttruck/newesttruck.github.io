<p>
The Fuel Economy score is distinct by comparing the estimated entire sum mpg for all car in the lineup to the fixed competitive set. If there are no EPA figures available, the manufacturer's estimations of mpg are used instead. If the competitor set does not additionally allow hybrid or PHEV models, hybrid and plug-in electric variations within a lineup that considerably lowers their sum average will not be included in the comparison. Based upon the comparative mile per gallon equivalent, or MPGe, and the kilowatts consumed per 100 miles, utter electric vehicles will be scored.

A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver instruction display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may plus use a rotary knob, touchpad, or further run method to action a non-touchscreen display. well-liked technologies following wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are resolved supplementary points.
</p>
<p>

Rear seat legroom measurement and comparison to the specified competitive set are moreover definite points. A further reduction is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the assist seat or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>

Reviewers moreover take into account versatile loading features and creative storage solutions. Additionally, points are unchangeable based on how the rear cargo preserve or trunk's measurements relate to the fixed competitive set. A supplementary tapering off is awarded to vehicles as soon as the best cargo or trunk proclaim in their segment.
