A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver assistance display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may also use a rotary knob, touchpad, or extra control method to deed a non-touchscreen display. popular technologies considering wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are supreme supplementary points.

</p>
<p>
The score for cargo appearance and storage is determined by the reviewer's evaluation of the vehicle's large and little cargo areas (as without difficulty as small-item storage), as with ease as how effectively they fulfill their expected functions and create efficient use of easily reached space. Reviewers next say yes into account versatile loading features and creative storage solutions. Additionally, points are resolution based upon how the rear cargo keep or trunk's measurements relate to the prearranged competitive set.
