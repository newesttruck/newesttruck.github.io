A added point is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the help chair or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
The score for cargo song and storage is certain by the reviewer's review of the vehicle's large and small cargo areas (as without difficulty as small-item storage), as with ease as how effectively they fulfill their expected functions and create efficient use of easy to get to space.
