A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver guidance display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may then use a rotary knob, touchpad, or other govern method to take action a non-touchscreen display. well-liked technologies gone wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are fixed idea further points.
</p>

Rear chair legroom measurement and comparison to the specified competitive set are after that resolved points. A added lessening is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the assist chair or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
