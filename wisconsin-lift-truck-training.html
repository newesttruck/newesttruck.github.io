    <h2>Overall: JLG 600 Series Wisconsin Lift Truck</h2>
    <p>
A vehicle's handling, braking, acceleration, ride quality, and further qualitative play in metrics including horsepower, torque, zero-to-60 time, and summit speed are all evaluated subjectively to determine the function score. The triumph of trucks and SUVs to tow is in addition to taken into account. The vehicles' behave is contrasted afterward the specified competitive set. afterward reviewing a vehicle though it is creature driven, experts look for characteristics that are in origin in the same way as both consumer and manufacturer expectations.
</p>
<p>
The Fuel Economy score is sure by comparing the estimated sum up mpg for every car in the lineup to the prearranged competitive set. If there are no EPA figures available, the manufacturer's estimations of mpg are used instead. If the competitor set does not additionally allow hybrid or PHEV models, hybrid and plug-in electric variations within a lineup that considerably lowers their total average will not be included in the comparison. Based upon the comparative mile per gallon equivalent, or MPGe, and the kilowatts consumed per 100 miles, resolved electric vehicles will be scored.
</p>
<p>
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crash exam data form the basis of the Safety score. Neither agency has yet to rate a vehicle, thus it receives no points. Points truth for specific cutting-edge driver-assistance safety technologies that arrive as all right on the lowest trim are after that factored into the safety ranking. Forbes Wheels believes that the considering nine safety features must be included as ration of the pleasing offering: alleyway departure warning, lecture to emergency automatic braking, automatic high beams, blind spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, adaptive cruise control, and one of its higher-level variants, lane keeping guidance or passage centering. For vehicles to get points, they must include at least four of them in their regular offering.

</p>
<p>
Based on points given for positive elements included as customary equipment on the base trim, the infotainment score is calculated. certain characteristics that are becoming more and more well-liked have been adopted by both premium and growth publicize manufacturers, according to Forbes Wheels. A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver information display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may also use a rotary knob, touchpad, or supplementary control method to affect a non-touchscreen display. popular technologies taking into account wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are answer extra points.
</p>
<p>
The comfort, ergonomics, and general interior atmosphere of the vehicle, as skillfully as the efficient use of space, are all taken into account later than determining the Comfort & Room score. Rear seat legroom measurement and comparison to the specified competitive set are also pure points. A added lessening is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the incite chair or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
The score for cargo announce and storage is determined by the reviewer's review of the vehicle's large and small cargo areas (as without difficulty as small-item storage), as without difficulty as how effectively they fulfill their designed functions and create efficient use of manageable space. Reviewers in addition to acknowledge into account versatile loading features and creative storage solutions. Additionally, points are utter based on how the rear cargo maintain or trunk's measurements relate to the fixed competitive set. A further lessening is awarded to vehicles taking into account the best cargo or trunk tell in their segment.
