</p>
<p>
The Fuel Economy score is clear by comparing the estimated combine mpg for all car in the lineup to the selected competitive set. If there are no EPA figures available, the manufacturer's estimations of mpg are used instead.

A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver guidance display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may then use a rotary knob, touchpad, or supplementary manage method to show a non-touchscreen display. well-liked technologies as soon as wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are definite supplementary points.
</p>
<p>

Rear seat legroom measurement and comparison to the specified competitive set are with definite points. A further lessening is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the urge on chair or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
