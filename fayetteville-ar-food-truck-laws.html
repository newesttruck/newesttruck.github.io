If there are no EPA figures available, the manufacturer's estimations of mpg are used instead. If the competitor set does not additionally find the money for hybrid or PHEV models, hybrid and plug-in electric variations within a lineup that considerably lowers their total average will not be included in the comparison.

A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver suggestion display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may after that use a rotary knob, touchpad, or supplementary direct method to perform a non-touchscreen display. well-liked technologies bearing in mind wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are conclusive new points.
</p>
<p>
