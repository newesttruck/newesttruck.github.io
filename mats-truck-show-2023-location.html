    <h2>Overall: WeatherTech TechLiner Custom Truck Bed Mat Black WeatherTech Truck</h2>
    <p>
A vehicle's handling, braking, acceleration, ride quality, and other qualitative feign metrics including horsepower, torque, zero-to-60 time, and summit readiness are all evaluated subjectively to determine the put-on score. The ability of trucks and SUVs to tow is plus taken into account. The vehicles' work is contrasted bearing in mind the specified competitive set. later than reviewing a vehicle even if it is being driven, experts look for characteristics that are in pedigree in imitation of both consumer and manufacturer expectations.
</p>
<p>
The Fuel Economy score is clear by comparing the estimated combine mpg for every car in the lineup to the selected competitive set. If there are no EPA figures available, the manufacturer's estimations of mpg are used instead. If the competitor set does not additionally allow hybrid or PHEV models, hybrid and plug-in electric variations within a lineup that considerably lowers their sum average will not be included in the comparison. Based on the comparative mile per gallon equivalent, or MPGe, and the kilowatts consumed per 100 miles, unconditional electric vehicles will be scored.
</p>
<p>
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crash exam data form the basis of the Safety score. Neither agency has yet to rate a vehicle, consequently it receives no points. Points unmovable for specific cutting-edge driver-assistance safety technologies that come as tolerable on the lowest trim are next factored into the safety ranking. Forbes Wheels believes that the following nine safety features must be included as allowance of the up to standard offering: path departure warning, take up emergency automatic braking, automatic high beams, blind spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, adaptive cruise control, and one of its higher-level variants, pathway keeping counsel or passage centering. For vehicles to get points, they must combine at least four of them in their regular offering. Vehicles that pay for a Level 2 self-driving system, (a amalgamation of adaptive cruise govern and path centering) are eligible for a other point.
</p>
<p>
Based upon points given for clear elements included as agreeable equipment on the base trim, the infotainment score is calculated. determined characteristics that are becoming more and more popular have been adopted by both premium and growth push manufacturers, according to Forbes Wheels. A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver assistance display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may then use a rotary knob, touchpad, or extra rule method to perform a non-touchscreen display. well-liked technologies in the same way as wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are unmovable supplementary points.
</p>
<p>
The comfort, ergonomics, and general interior feel of the vehicle, as well as the efficient use of space, are all taken into account similar to determining the Comfort & Room score. Rear chair legroom measurement and comparison to the specified competitive set are afterward perfect points. A added tapering off is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the incite seat or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
The score for cargo publicize and storage is distinct by the reviewer's evaluation of the vehicle's large and little cargo areas (as without difficulty as small-item storage), as skillfully as how effectively they fulfill their expected functions and make efficient use of understandable space. Reviewers after that undertake into account versatile loading features and creative storage solutions. Additionally, points are total based on how the rear cargo withhold or trunk's measurements relate to the selected competitive set. A added reduction is awarded to vehicles later the best cargo or trunk expose in their segment.
</p>
<p>
The Styling score is a judgment of a vehicle's overall interior and exterior styling and design. Reviewers plus receive into account how the interior is organized and how capably the design supports the purpose. A factor is the build quality.</p>
