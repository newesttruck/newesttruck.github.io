<p>
The Fuel Economy score is sure by comparing the estimated summative mpg for every car in the lineup to the chosen competitive set.

A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver recommendation display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may then use a rotary knob, touchpad, or additional govern method to play a part a non-touchscreen display. popular technologies next wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are pure further points.
</p>
<p>

Rear chair legroom measurement and comparison to the specified competitive set are next supreme points. A bonus point is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the back chair or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
The score for cargo vent and storage is certain by the reviewer's evaluation of the vehicle's large and small cargo areas (as without difficulty as small-item storage), as competently as how effectively they fulfill their designed functions and create efficient use of affable space. Reviewers plus admit into account versatile loading features and creative storage solutions. Additionally, points are conclusive based on how the rear cargo support or trunk's measurements relate to the fixed competitive set.
