<p>
The Fuel Economy score is sure by comparing the estimated mass mpg for every car in the lineup to the chosen competitive set. If there are no EPA figures available, the manufacturer's estimations of mpg are used instead.

Neither agency has yet to rate a vehicle, hence it receives no points. Points perfect for specific cutting-edge driver-assistance safety technologies that come as all right upon the lowest trim are then factored into the safety ranking. Forbes Wheels believes that the later nine safety features must be included as ration of the suitable offering: alleyway departure warning, dispatch emergency automatic braking, automatic tall beams, blind spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, adaptive cruise control, and one of its higher-level variants, lane keeping opinion or path centering.

A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver recommendation display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may as a consequence use a rotary knob, touchpad, or extra control method to statute a non-touchscreen display. popular technologies in the same way as wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are complete other points.
</p>
<p>

Rear chair legroom measurement and comparison to the specified competitive set are after that unlimited points. A bonus lessening is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the urge on seat or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
