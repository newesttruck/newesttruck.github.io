A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver recommendation display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may in addition to use a rotary knob, touchpad, or supplementary manage method to be in a non-touchscreen display. popular technologies next wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are unconditional further points.

A other lessening is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the urge on seat or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
