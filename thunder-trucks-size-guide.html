A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver opinion display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may after that use a rotary knob, touchpad, or new rule method to put on an act a non-touchscreen display. well-liked technologies later wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are definite supplementary points.
</p>
<p>

Rear seat legroom measurement and comparison to the specified competitive set are moreover total points. A extra reduction is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the assist seat or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
The score for cargo appearance and storage is definite by the reviewer's evaluation of the vehicle's large and little cargo areas (as capably as small-item storage), as well as how effectively they fulfill their meant functions and make efficient use of nearby space.
