A other tapering off is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the support seat or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>

Reviewers moreover put up with into account versatile loading features and creative storage solutions. Additionally, points are fixed based on how the rear cargo support or trunk's measurements relate to the prearranged competitive set.
