<p>
The Fuel Economy score is certain by comparing the estimated mass mpg for all car in the lineup to the prearranged competitive set. If there are no EPA figures available, the manufacturer's estimations of mpg are used instead.

Premium vehicles may after that use a rotary knob, touchpad, or new rule method to operate a non-touchscreen display. well-liked technologies similar to wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are given supplementary points.
</p>
<p>

Rear seat legroom measurement and comparison to the specified competitive set are also unqualified points. A added narrowing is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the encourage seat or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
