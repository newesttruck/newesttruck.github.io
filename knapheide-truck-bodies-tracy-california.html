<p>
The Fuel Economy score is clear by comparing the estimated total mpg for every car in the lineup to the agreed competitive set. If there are no EPA figures available, the manufacturer's estimations of mpg are used instead.

A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver suggestion display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may then use a rotary knob, touchpad, or new direct method to put on an act a non-touchscreen display. well-liked technologies later wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are unlimited further points.
</p>
<p>
The comfort, ergonomics, and general interior feel of the vehicle, as capably as the efficient use of space, are every taken into account as soon as determining the Comfort & Room score. Rear seat legroom measurement and comparison to the specified competitive set are as well as supreme points. A further dwindling is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the encourage chair or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
The score for cargo reveal and storage is distinct by the reviewer's review of the vehicle's large and little cargo areas (as with ease as small-item storage), as competently as how effectively they fulfill their expected functions and create efficient use of reachable space.
