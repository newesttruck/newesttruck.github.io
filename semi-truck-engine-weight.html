</p>
<p>
The Fuel Economy score is definite by comparing the estimated total mpg for every car in the lineup to the agreed competitive set. If there are no EPA figures available, the manufacturer's estimations of mpg are used instead. If the competitor set does not additionally give hybrid or PHEV models, hybrid and plug-in electric variations within a lineup that considerably lowers their total average will not be included in the comparison.

Rear chair legroom measurement and comparison to the specified competitive set are in addition to supreme points. A further dwindling is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the help chair or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
The score for cargo aerate and storage is definite by the reviewer's review of the vehicle's large and little cargo areas (as competently as small-item storage), as well as how effectively they fulfill their meant functions and create efficient use of user-friendly space.
