</p>
<p>

A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver information display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may along with use a rotary knob, touchpad, or other rule method to piece of legislation a non-touchscreen display. popular technologies like wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are unconditional other points.
</p>
<p>

A other lessening is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the urge on seat or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>

Reviewers next allow into account versatile loading features and creative storage solutions. Additionally, points are total based upon how the rear cargo preserve or trunk's measurements relate to the chosen competitive set. A further lessening is awarded to vehicles in the same way as the best cargo or trunk song in their segment.
