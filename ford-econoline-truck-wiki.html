</p>
<p>
The Fuel Economy score is sure by comparing the estimated comprehensive mpg for every car in the lineup to the agreed competitive set. If there are no EPA figures available, the manufacturer's estimations of mpg are used instead. If the competitor set does not additionally present hybrid or PHEV models, hybrid and plug-in electric variations within a lineup that considerably lowers their total average will not be included in the comparison.

A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver suggestion display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may moreover use a rotary knob, touchpad, or new manage method to take action a non-touchscreen display. well-liked technologies similar to wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are unqualified new points.
</p>
<p>
