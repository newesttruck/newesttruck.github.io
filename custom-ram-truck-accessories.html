A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver instruction display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may furthermore use a rotary knob, touchpad, or supplementary rule method to enactment a non-touchscreen display. popular technologies in the manner of wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are supreme supplementary points.
