</p>
<p>
The Fuel Economy score is sure by comparing the estimated entire sum mpg for all car in the lineup to the selected competitive set. If there are no EPA figures available, the manufacturer's estimations of mpg are used instead. If the competitor set does not additionally meet the expense of hybrid or PHEV models, hybrid and plug-in electric variations within a lineup that considerably lowers their total average will not be included in the comparison. Based on the comparative mile per gallon equivalent, or MPGe, and the kilowatts consumed per 100 miles, utter electric vehicles will be scored.
</p>

A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver counsel display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may as well as use a rotary knob, touchpad, or other manage method to put it on a non-touchscreen display. popular technologies later than wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are pure extra points.
</p>
<p>

Rear seat legroom measurement and comparison to the specified competitive set are also given points. A other point is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the put up to seat or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
The score for cargo publicize and storage is certain by the reviewer's evaluation of the vehicle's large and little cargo areas (as with ease as small-item storage), as skillfully as how effectively they fulfill their intended functions and make efficient use of welcoming space.
