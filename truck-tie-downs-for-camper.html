<p>
The Fuel Economy score is definite by comparing the estimated mass mpg for all car in the lineup to the agreed competitive set. If there are no EPA figures available, the manufacturer's estimations of mpg are used instead. If the competitor set does not additionally have enough money hybrid or PHEV models, hybrid and plug-in electric variations within a lineup that considerably lowers their sum average will not be included in the comparison.

Premium vehicles may after that use a rotary knob, touchpad, or other control method to perform a non-touchscreen display. well-liked technologies following wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are answer new points.
</p>
