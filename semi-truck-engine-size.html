<p>
The Fuel Economy score is clear by comparing the estimated summative mpg for every car in the lineup to the agreed competitive set. If there are no EPA figures available, the manufacturer's estimations of mpg are used instead. If the competitor set does not additionally meet the expense of hybrid or PHEV models, hybrid and plug-in electric variations within a lineup that considerably lowers their total average will not be included in the comparison.

A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver information display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may as a consequence use a rotary knob, touchpad, or additional govern method to do something a non-touchscreen display. popular technologies afterward wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are utter additional points.
</p>
<p>

Rear seat legroom measurement and comparison to the specified competitive set are also resolution points. A added narrowing is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the encourage chair or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
The score for cargo spread and storage is positive by the reviewer's evaluation of the vehicle's large and little cargo areas (as capably as small-item storage), as skillfully as how effectively they fulfill their intended functions and make efficient use of welcoming space. Reviewers after that take on into account versatile loading features and creative storage solutions. Additionally, points are resolved based on how the rear cargo keep or trunk's measurements relate to the chosen competitive set.
