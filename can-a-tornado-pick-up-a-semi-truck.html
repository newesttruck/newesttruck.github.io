        That would depend on the tornado… but probably not if it was a direct strike. The red car is flipped a couple of times on the highway before landing upright and continuing to drive away, seemingly unscathed from. The answer is no and here is why:
    </p>
    <h2>Overall: 48foot 1974 Fruehauf SemiTrailer 3,000 • Warehouse Options</h2>
    <p>
A vehicle's handling, braking, acceleration, ride quality, and other qualitative play a role metrics including horsepower, torque, zero-to-60 time, and top speed are every evaluated subjectively to determine the enactment score. The deed of trucks and SUVs to tow is plus taken into account. The vehicles' fake is contrasted like the specified competitive set. in the same way as reviewing a vehicle even though it is creature driven, experts see for characteristics that are in parentage past both consumer and manufacturer expectations.
</p>
<p>
The Fuel Economy score is definite by comparing the estimated collection mpg for all car in the lineup to the prearranged competitive set. If there are no EPA figures available, the manufacturer's estimations of mpg are used instead. If the competitor set does not additionally allow hybrid or PHEV models, hybrid and plug-in electric variations within a lineup that considerably lowers their sum average will not be included in the comparison. Based on the comparative mile per gallon equivalent, or MPGe, and the kilowatts consumed per 100 miles, fixed idea electric vehicles will be scored.
</p>
<p>
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety smash test data form the basis of the Safety score. Neither agency has yet to rate a vehicle, in view of that it receives no points. Points given for specific cutting-edge driver-assistance safety technologies that arrive as all right on the lowest trim are plus factored into the safety ranking. Forbes Wheels believes that the subsequently nine safety features must be included as ration of the within acceptable limits offering: alleyway departure warning, direct emergency automatic braking, automatic high beams, blind spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, adaptive cruise control, and one of its higher-level variants, passage keeping counsel or passage centering. For vehicles to gain points, they must put in at least four of them in their regular offering. Vehicles that have enough money a Level 2 self-driving system, (a assimilation of adaptive cruise run and alleyway centering) are eligible for a bonus point.
</p>
<p>
Based on points answer for definite elements included as agreeable equipment upon the base trim, the infotainment score is calculated. determined characteristics that are becoming more and more well-liked have been adopted by both premium and deposit publicize manufacturers, according to Forbes Wheels. A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver opinion display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may next use a rotary knob, touchpad, or extra manage method to operate a non-touchscreen display. popular technologies later than wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are supreme further points.
</p>
<p>
The comfort, ergonomics, and general interior atmosphere of the vehicle, as skillfully as the efficient use of space, are every taken into account later than determining the Comfort & Room score. Rear chair legroom measurement and comparison to the specified competitive set are also unquestionable points. A bonus narrowing is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the put up to seat or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
The score for cargo song and storage is definite by the reviewer's review of the vehicle's large and small cargo areas (as capably as small-item storage), as with ease as how effectively they fulfill their expected functions and make efficient use of available space. Reviewers as well as give a positive response into account versatile loading features and creative storage solutions. Additionally, points are fixed based upon how the rear cargo support or trunk's measurements relate to the selected competitive set. A other lessening is awarded to vehicles later than the best cargo or trunk announce in their segment.
</p>
<p>
The Styling score is a judgment of a vehicle's overall interior and exterior styling and design. Reviewers next agree to into account how the interior is organized and how without difficulty the design supports the purpose. A factor is the construct quality.</p>
