A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver recommendation display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may then use a rotary knob, touchpad, or extra control method to put it on a non-touchscreen display. popular technologies next wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are answer additional points.
