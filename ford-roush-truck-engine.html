</p>
<p>
The Fuel Economy score is certain by comparing the estimated accumulate mpg for every car in the lineup to the agreed competitive set. If there are no EPA figures available, the manufacturer's estimations of mpg are used instead. If the competitor set does not additionally meet the expense of hybrid or PHEV models, hybrid and plug-in electric variations within a lineup that considerably lowers their sum average will not be included in the comparison.

A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver guidance display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may afterward use a rotary knob, touchpad, or extra rule method to work a non-touchscreen display. popular technologies like wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are perfect additional points.
</p>
<p>
The comfort, ergonomics, and general interior atmosphere of the vehicle, as skillfully as the efficient use of space, are all taken into account as soon as determining the Comfort & Room score. Rear seat legroom measurement and comparison to the specified competitive set are after that pure points. A added point is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the help chair or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
The score for cargo heavens and storage is definite by the reviewer's review of the vehicle's large and little cargo areas (as without difficulty as small-item storage), as without difficulty as how effectively they fulfill their designed functions and create efficient use of within reach space. Reviewers moreover say you will into account versatile loading features and creative storage solutions.
