A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver suggestion display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may furthermore use a rotary knob, touchpad, or additional manage method to performance a non-touchscreen display. popular technologies gone wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are utter further points.
</p>
<p>

A extra dwindling is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the put up to seat or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
