<p>
The Fuel Economy score is certain by comparing the estimated collective mpg for every car in the lineup to the chosen competitive set. If there are no EPA figures available, the manufacturer's estimations of mpg are used instead.

A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver guidance display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may afterward use a rotary knob, touchpad, or extra govern method to ham it up a non-touchscreen display. well-liked technologies subsequently wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are conclusive new points.
</p>
<p>
The comfort, ergonomics, and general interior atmosphere of the vehicle, as competently as the efficient use of space, are every taken into account in the manner of determining the Comfort & Room score. Rear seat legroom measurement and comparison to the specified competitive set are afterward utter points. A added lessening is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the put up to chair or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
The score for cargo reveal and storage is determined by the reviewer's review of the vehicle's large and little cargo areas (as capably as small-item storage), as competently as how effectively they fulfill their intended functions and make efficient use of simple space. Reviewers with acknowledge into account versatile loading features and creative storage solutions. Additionally, points are unqualified based upon how the rear cargo sustain or trunk's measurements relate to the prearranged competitive set.
