A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver guidance display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may next use a rotary knob, touchpad, or additional control method to pretend a non-touchscreen display. popular technologies taking into account wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are resolved extra points.
</p>
<p>

A bonus dwindling is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the help seat or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
The score for cargo expose and storage is positive by the reviewer's review of the vehicle's large and little cargo areas (as without difficulty as small-item storage), as capably as how effectively they fulfill their designed functions and make efficient use of genial space. Reviewers in addition to agree to into account versatile loading features and creative storage solutions.
