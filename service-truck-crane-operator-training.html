The Fuel Economy score is clear by comparing the estimated total mpg for all car in the lineup to the selected competitive set. If there are no EPA figures available, the manufacturer's estimations of mpg are used instead.

A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver instruction display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may moreover use a rotary knob, touchpad, or further direct method to decree a non-touchscreen display. well-liked technologies once wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are unchangeable supplementary points.
</p>
<p>

Rear chair legroom measurement and comparison to the specified competitive set are plus perfect points. A further lessening is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the back up seat or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
The score for cargo melody and storage is sure by the reviewer's review of the vehicle's large and small cargo areas (as capably as small-item storage), as with ease as how effectively they fulfill their meant functions and make efficient use of available space. Reviewers next take into account versatile loading features and creative storage solutions.
