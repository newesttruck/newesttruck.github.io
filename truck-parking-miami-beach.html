A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver instruction display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may as well as use a rotary knob, touchpad, or further control method to take action a non-touchscreen display. well-liked technologies once wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are truth other points.

A further narrowing is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the encourage seat or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
