Rear chair legroom measurement and comparison to the specified competitive set are in addition to unquestionable points. A extra lessening is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the support chair or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
The score for cargo circulate and storage is distinct by the reviewer's review of the vehicle's large and small cargo areas (as skillfully as small-item storage), as without difficulty as how effectively they fulfill their designed functions and make efficient use of nearby space.
