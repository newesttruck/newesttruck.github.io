    <h2>Overall: Flatbed Trucking Company in Houston, TX</h2>
    <p>

The vehicles' produce a result is contrasted subsequent to the specified competitive set. similar to reviewing a vehicle though it is bodily driven, experts see for characteristics that are in descent behind both consumer and manufacturer expectations.
</p>
<p>
The Fuel Economy score is definite by comparing the estimated whole mpg for all car in the lineup to the fixed competitive set. If there are no EPA figures available, the manufacturer's estimations of mpg are used instead. If the competitor set does not additionally have the funds for hybrid or PHEV models, hybrid and plug-in electric variations within a lineup that considerably lowers their total average will not be included in the comparison. Based on the comparative mile per gallon equivalent, or MPGe, and the kilowatts consumed per 100 miles, conclusive electric vehicles will be scored.
</p>
<p>
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety wreck exam data form the basis of the Safety score. Neither agency has yet to rate a vehicle, appropriately it receives no points.

Forbes Wheels believes that the next nine safety features must be included as share of the pleasing offering: passageway departure warning, speak to emergency automatic braking, automatic tall beams, blind spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, adaptive cruise control, and one of its higher-level variants, passage keeping suggestion or passageway centering. For vehicles to get points, they must tally at least four of them in their regular offering. Vehicles that pay for a Level 2 self-driving system, (a raptness of adaptive cruise direct and pathway centering) are eligible for a added point.
</p>
<p>
Based upon points answer for determined elements included as standard equipment upon the base trim, the infotainment score is calculated. certain characteristics that are becoming more and more well-liked have been adopted by both premium and growth publicize manufacturers, according to Forbes Wheels. A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver assistance display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may also use a rotary knob, touchpad, or additional rule method to take steps a non-touchscreen display. popular technologies afterward wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are unconditional other points.
</p>
<p>
The comfort, ergonomics, and general interior air of the vehicle, as competently as the efficient use of space, are all taken into account similar to determining the Comfort & Room score. Rear seat legroom measurement and comparison to the specified competitive set are moreover unmovable points. A supplementary point is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the encourage chair or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
The score for cargo tone and storage is distinct by the reviewer's review of the vehicle's large and small cargo areas (as without difficulty as small-item storage), as competently as how effectively they fulfill their intended functions and make efficient use of to hand space. Reviewers also receive into account versatile loading features and creative storage solutions. Additionally, points are complete based on how the rear cargo hold or trunk's measurements relate to the fixed competitive set. A added dwindling is awarded to vehicles once the best cargo or trunk space in their segment.
