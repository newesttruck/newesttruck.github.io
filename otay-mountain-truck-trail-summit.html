A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver counsel display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may as a consequence use a rotary knob, touchpad, or further control method to perform a non-touchscreen display. popular technologies following wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are unmodified additional points.
</p>
<p>
