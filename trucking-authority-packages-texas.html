The Fuel Economy score is certain by comparing the estimated combination mpg for all car in the lineup to the fixed competitive set. If there are no EPA figures available, the manufacturer's estimations of mpg are used instead.

A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver assistance display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may as well as use a rotary knob, touchpad, or further govern method to fake a non-touchscreen display. popular technologies gone wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are total additional points.
