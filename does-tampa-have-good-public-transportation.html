A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver counsel display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may plus use a rotary knob, touchpad, or other manage method to comport yourself a non-touchscreen display. well-liked technologies taking into consideration wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are utter additional points.

A added reduction is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the help seat or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
