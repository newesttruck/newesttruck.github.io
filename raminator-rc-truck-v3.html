<p>
The Fuel Economy score is distinct by comparing the estimated whole mpg for all car in the lineup to the fixed competitive set. If there are no EPA figures available, the manufacturer's estimations of mpg are used instead.

A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver opinion display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may afterward use a rotary knob, touchpad, or extra manage method to affect a non-touchscreen display. popular technologies taking into account wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are fixed idea further points.
</p>

Rear seat legroom measurement and comparison to the specified competitive set are furthermore pure points. A bonus dwindling is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the help seat or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
