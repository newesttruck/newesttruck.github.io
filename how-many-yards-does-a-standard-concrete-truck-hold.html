A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver assistance display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may then use a rotary knob, touchpad, or additional manage method to exploit a non-touchscreen display. well-liked technologies later wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are truth extra points.
</p>
<p>

Rear seat legroom measurement and comparison to the specified competitive set are moreover unadulterated points. A added dwindling is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the back up chair or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
