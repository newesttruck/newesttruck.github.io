Rear seat legroom measurement and comparison to the specified competitive set are next unqualified points. A extra lessening is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the assist chair or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
The score for cargo expose and storage is distinct by the reviewer's review of the vehicle's large and small cargo areas (as skillfully as small-item storage), as capably as how effectively they fulfill their intended functions and create efficient use of easily reached space. Reviewers moreover take into account versatile loading features and creative storage solutions. Additionally, points are complete based upon how the rear cargo withhold or trunk's measurements relate to the agreed competitive set.
