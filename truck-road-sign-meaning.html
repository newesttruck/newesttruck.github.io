</p>
<p>
The Fuel Economy score is sure by comparing the estimated summative mpg for every car in the lineup to the agreed competitive set. If there are no EPA figures available, the manufacturer's estimations of mpg are used instead. If the competitor set does not additionally manage to pay for hybrid or PHEV models, hybrid and plug-in electric variations within a lineup that considerably lowers their total average will not be included in the comparison. Based upon the comparative mile per gallon equivalent, or MPGe, and the kilowatts consumed per 100 miles, unconditional electric vehicles will be scored.

A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver instruction display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may as well as use a rotary knob, touchpad, or additional manage method to function a non-touchscreen display. well-liked technologies similar to wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are conclusive new points.
</p>
<p>
The comfort, ergonomics, and general interior vibes of the vehicle, as skillfully as the efficient use of space, are all taken into account behind determining the Comfort & Room score. Rear seat legroom measurement and comparison to the specified competitive set are as a consequence answer points. A supplementary tapering off is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the put up to seat or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
The score for cargo circulate and storage is certain by the reviewer's review of the vehicle's large and small cargo areas (as without difficulty as small-item storage), as without difficulty as how effectively they fulfill their expected functions and make efficient use of handy space.
