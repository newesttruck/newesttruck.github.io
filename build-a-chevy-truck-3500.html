</p>
<p>
The Fuel Economy score is sure by comparing the estimated comprehensive mpg for every car in the lineup to the fixed competitive set. If there are no EPA figures available, the manufacturer's estimations of mpg are used instead. If the competitor set does not additionally give hybrid or PHEV models, hybrid and plug-in electric variations within a lineup that considerably lowers their sum average will not be included in the comparison. Based upon the comparative mile per gallon equivalent, or MPGe, and the kilowatts consumed per 100 miles, final electric vehicles will be scored.
</p>
<p>

A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver recommendation display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may along with use a rotary knob, touchpad, or extra control method to exploit a non-touchscreen display. well-liked technologies next wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are unqualified extra points.
</p>
<p>
The comfort, ergonomics, and general interior feel of the vehicle, as well as the efficient use of space, are every taken into account past determining the Comfort & Room score. Rear chair legroom measurement and comparison to the specified competitive set are with unquestionable points. A extra point is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the help seat or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>

Reviewers in addition to endure into account versatile loading features and creative storage solutions. Additionally, points are definite based on how the rear cargo retain or trunk's measurements relate to the agreed competitive set.
