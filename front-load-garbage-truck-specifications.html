<p>
The Fuel Economy score is sure by comparing the estimated sum up mpg for every car in the lineup to the agreed competitive set. If there are no EPA figures available, the manufacturer's estimations of mpg are used instead. If the competitor set does not additionally come up with the money for hybrid or PHEV models, hybrid and plug-in electric variations within a lineup that considerably lowers their total average will not be included in the comparison.

A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver recommendation display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may next use a rotary knob, touchpad, or further manage method to piece of legislation a non-touchscreen display. well-liked technologies taking into account wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are firm further points.
</p>
<p>

Rear seat legroom measurement and comparison to the specified competitive set are then solution points. A added point is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the put up to seat or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
The score for cargo manner and storage is positive by the reviewer's evaluation of the vehicle's large and little cargo areas (as with ease as small-item storage), as without difficulty as how effectively they fulfill their intended functions and create efficient use of user-friendly space.
