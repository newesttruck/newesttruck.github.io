<p>
The Fuel Economy score is determined by comparing the estimated total mpg for every car in the lineup to the selected competitive set. If there are no EPA figures available, the manufacturer's estimations of mpg are used instead. If the competitor set does not additionally allow hybrid or PHEV models, hybrid and plug-in electric variations within a lineup that considerably lowers their sum average will not be included in the comparison.

A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver recommendation display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may then use a rotary knob, touchpad, or new run method to work a non-touchscreen display. well-liked technologies subsequently wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are final further points.
</p>
<p>
The comfort, ergonomics, and general interior atmosphere of the vehicle, as competently as the efficient use of space, are every taken into account considering determining the Comfort & Room score. Rear seat legroom measurement and comparison to the specified competitive set are afterward answer points. A bonus dwindling is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the support chair or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
The score for cargo ventilate and storage is determined by the reviewer's review of the vehicle's large and small cargo areas (as capably as small-item storage), as well as how effectively they fulfill their designed functions and create efficient use of handy space. Reviewers as a consequence assume into account versatile loading features and creative storage solutions. Additionally, points are resolved based on how the rear cargo keep or trunk's measurements relate to the fixed competitive set. A added point is awarded to vehicles afterward the best cargo or trunk circulate in their segment.
