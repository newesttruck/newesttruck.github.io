<p>
The Fuel Economy score is sure by comparing the estimated mass mpg for all car in the lineup to the selected competitive set.

A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver guidance display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may along with use a rotary knob, touchpad, or supplementary rule method to law a non-touchscreen display. well-liked technologies subsequently wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are complete new points.
</p>
<p>

Rear chair legroom measurement and comparison to the specified competitive set are with resolved points. A further reduction is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the assist chair or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
The score for cargo appearance and storage is distinct by the reviewer's review of the vehicle's large and small cargo areas (as skillfully as small-item storage), as competently as how effectively they fulfill their expected functions and make efficient use of approachable space.
