A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver recommendation display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may next use a rotary knob, touchpad, or additional run method to achievement a non-touchscreen display. well-liked technologies gone wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are perfect supplementary points.
</p>
<p>

Rear seat legroom measurement and comparison to the specified competitive set are then unchangeable points. A bonus narrowing is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the back up chair or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
