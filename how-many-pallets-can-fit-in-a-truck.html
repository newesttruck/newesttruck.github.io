</p>
<p>
The Fuel Economy score is certain by comparing the estimated total mpg for every car in the lineup to the agreed competitive set. If there are no EPA figures available, the manufacturer's estimations of mpg are used instead. If the competitor set does not additionally manage to pay for hybrid or PHEV models, hybrid and plug-in electric variations within a lineup that considerably lowers their total average will not be included in the comparison. Based upon the comparative mile per gallon equivalent, or MPGe, and the kilowatts consumed per 100 miles, final electric vehicles will be scored.

A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver guidance display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may also use a rotary knob, touchpad, or other direct method to put it on a non-touchscreen display. well-liked technologies next wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are fixed further points.
</p>
<p>
The comfort, ergonomics, and general interior atmosphere of the vehicle, as competently as the efficient use of space, are all taken into account in the same way as determining the Comfort & Room score. Rear chair legroom measurement and comparison to the specified competitive set are moreover unmovable points. A supplementary reduction is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the encourage seat or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
The score for cargo tell and storage is positive by the reviewer's review of the vehicle's large and little cargo areas (as competently as small-item storage), as competently as how effectively they fulfill their expected functions and make efficient use of clear space.
