A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver recommendation display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may afterward use a rotary knob, touchpad, or other control method to law a non-touchscreen display. popular technologies in the same way as wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are conclusive additional points.
</p>
<p>

Rear chair legroom measurement and comparison to the specified competitive set are next pure points. A supplementary point is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the help seat or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
The score for cargo freshen and storage is determined by the reviewer's review of the vehicle's large and small cargo areas (as skillfully as small-item storage), as skillfully as how effectively they fulfill their meant functions and make efficient use of welcoming space.
