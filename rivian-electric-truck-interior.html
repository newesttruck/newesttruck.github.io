</p>
<p>
The Fuel Economy score is distinct by comparing the estimated accumulate mpg for every car in the lineup to the agreed competitive set. If there are no EPA figures available, the manufacturer's estimations of mpg are used instead. If the competitor set does not additionally present hybrid or PHEV models, hybrid and plug-in electric variations within a lineup that considerably lowers their sum average will not be included in the comparison. Based on the comparative mile per gallon equivalent, or MPGe, and the kilowatts consumed per 100 miles, conclusive electric vehicles will be scored.

A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver guidance display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may with use a rotary knob, touchpad, or additional control method to statute a non-touchscreen display. popular technologies taking into account wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are total further points.

A extra lessening is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the assist seat or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
The score for cargo flavor and storage is positive by the reviewer's review of the vehicle's large and little cargo areas (as competently as small-item storage), as skillfully as how effectively they fulfill their expected functions and make efficient use of comprehensible space. Reviewers then believe into account versatile loading features and creative storage solutions. Additionally, points are given based upon how the rear cargo keep or trunk's measurements relate to the selected competitive set.
