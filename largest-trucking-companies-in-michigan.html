<p>
The Fuel Economy score is distinct by comparing the estimated total mpg for every car in the lineup to the agreed competitive set. If there are no EPA figures available, the manufacturer's estimations of mpg are used instead.

Premium vehicles may furthermore use a rotary knob, touchpad, or further direct method to perform a non-touchscreen display. well-liked technologies later than wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are unmodified new points.
</p>
<p>

Rear seat legroom measurement and comparison to the specified competitive set are in addition to truth points. A supplementary dwindling is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the incite seat or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
The score for cargo publicize and storage is positive by the reviewer's review of the vehicle's large and little cargo areas (as without difficulty as small-item storage), as without difficulty as how effectively they fulfill their expected functions and create efficient use of approachable space. Reviewers afterward bow to into account versatile loading features and creative storage solutions. Additionally, points are answer based upon how the rear cargo keep or trunk's measurements relate to the prearranged competitive set.
