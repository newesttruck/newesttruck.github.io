If there are no EPA figures available, the manufacturer's estimations of mpg are used instead. If the competitor set does not additionally provide hybrid or PHEV models, hybrid and plug-in electric variations within a lineup that considerably lowers their sum average will not be included in the comparison. Based upon the comparative mile per gallon equivalent, or MPGe, and the kilowatts consumed per 100 miles, unquestionable electric vehicles will be scored.
</p>

A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver assistance display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may plus use a rotary knob, touchpad, or additional govern method to put-on a non-touchscreen display. popular technologies similar to wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are pure further points.
</p>
<p>
The comfort, ergonomics, and general interior quality of the vehicle, as capably as the efficient use of space, are all taken into account subsequent to determining the Comfort & Room score. Rear seat legroom measurement and comparison to the specified competitive set are moreover conclusive points. A extra reduction is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the encourage chair or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>

Reviewers with understand into account versatile loading features and creative storage solutions. Additionally, points are unmodified based on how the rear cargo keep or trunk's measurements relate to the chosen competitive set.
