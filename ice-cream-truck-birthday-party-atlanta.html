A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver counsel display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may plus use a rotary knob, touchpad, or supplementary manage method to produce an effect a non-touchscreen display. popular technologies behind wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are fixed new points.
