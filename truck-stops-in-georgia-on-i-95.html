<p>
The Fuel Economy score is distinct by comparing the estimated summative mpg for all car in the lineup to the chosen competitive set. If there are no EPA figures available, the manufacturer's estimations of mpg are used instead. If the competitor set does not additionally present hybrid or PHEV models, hybrid and plug-in electric variations within a lineup that considerably lowers their sum average will not be included in the comparison.

A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver guidance display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may also use a rotary knob, touchpad, or other govern method to play in a non-touchscreen display. well-liked technologies past wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are unadulterated other points.
</p>
<p>

Reviewers in addition to put up with into account versatile loading features and creative storage solutions. Additionally, points are final based on how the rear cargo sustain or trunk's measurements relate to the agreed competitive set.
