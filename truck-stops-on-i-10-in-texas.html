<p>
The Fuel Economy score is clear by comparing the estimated total mpg for every car in the lineup to the fixed competitive set. If there are no EPA figures available, the manufacturer's estimations of mpg are used instead. If the competitor set does not additionally allow hybrid or PHEV models, hybrid and plug-in electric variations within a lineup that considerably lowers their total average will not be included in the comparison.

A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver assistance display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may plus use a rotary knob, touchpad, or extra control method to ham it up a non-touchscreen display. popular technologies taking into account wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are resolved further points.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
The score for cargo flavor and storage is distinct by the reviewer's review of the vehicle's large and small cargo areas (as skillfully as small-item storage), as without difficulty as how effectively they fulfill their intended functions and make efficient use of straightforward space. Reviewers in addition to recognize into account versatile loading features and creative storage solutions. Additionally, points are unqualified based upon how the rear cargo hold or trunk's measurements relate to the agreed competitive set.
