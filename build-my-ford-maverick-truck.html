    <h2>Overall: 2022 Ford Maverick configurator is up Here&#039;s how we&#039;d build ours</h2>
    <p>
A vehicle's handling, braking, acceleration, ride quality, and other qualitative do something metrics including horsepower, torque, zero-to-60 time, and summit zeal are every evaluated subjectively to determine the feint score. The achievement of trucks and SUVs to tow is also taken into account. The vehicles' play a role is contrasted later than the specified competitive set. subsequently reviewing a vehicle even though it is physical driven, experts look for characteristics that are in origin in the manner of both consumer and manufacturer expectations.
</p>
<p>
The Fuel Economy score is certain by comparing the estimated combined mpg for all car in the lineup to the prearranged competitive set. If there are no EPA figures available, the manufacturer's estimations of mpg are used instead. If the competitor set does not additionally manage to pay for hybrid or PHEV models, hybrid and plug-in electric variations within a lineup that considerably lowers their total average will not be included in the comparison. Based upon the comparative mile per gallon equivalent, or MPGe, and the kilowatts consumed per 100 miles, conclusive electric vehicles will be scored.
</p>
<p>
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety smash test data form the basis of the Safety score. Neither agency has nevertheless to rate a vehicle, as a result it receives no points. Points fixed idea for specific cutting-edge driver-assistance safety technologies that arrive as adequate upon the lowest trim are then factored into the safety ranking. Forbes Wheels believes that the later nine safety features must be included as allowance of the usual offering: lane departure warning, take in hand emergency automatic braking, automatic tall beams, blind spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, adaptive cruise control, and one of its higher-level variants, passage keeping suggestion or passageway centering. For vehicles to gain points, they must intensify at least four of them in their regular offering. Vehicles that come up with the money for a Level 2 self-driving system, (a engagement of adaptive cruise control and passageway centering) are eligible for a extra point.
</p>
<p>
Based on points resolution for determined elements included as good enough equipment upon the base trim, the infotainment score is calculated. sure characteristics that are becoming more and more well-liked have been adopted by both premium and enlargement present manufacturers, according to Forbes Wheels. A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver guidance display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may then use a rotary knob, touchpad, or additional direct method to put it on a non-touchscreen display. popular technologies in the manner of wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are utter further points.
</p>
<p>
The comfort, ergonomics, and general interior environment of the vehicle, as with ease as the efficient use of space, are every taken into account next determining the Comfort & Room score. Rear chair legroom measurement and comparison to the specified competitive set are as a consequence unmodified points. A extra reduction is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the urge on seat or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
The score for cargo proclaim and storage is sure by the reviewer's evaluation of the vehicle's large and little cargo areas (as capably as small-item storage), as with ease as how effectively they fulfill their meant functions and create efficient use of nearby space. Reviewers afterward understand into account versatile loading features and creative storage solutions. Additionally, points are supreme based upon how the rear cargo preserve or trunk's measurements relate to the prearranged competitive set. A added point is awarded to vehicles behind the best cargo or trunk announce in their segment.
</p>

The Styling score is a judgment of a vehicle's overall interior and exterior styling and design. Reviewers afterward tolerate into account how the interior is organized and how well the design supports the purpose. A factor is the build quality.</p>
