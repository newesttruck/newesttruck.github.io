<p>
The Fuel Economy score is clear by comparing the estimated cumulative mpg for every car in the lineup to the chosen competitive set. If there are no EPA figures available, the manufacturer's estimations of mpg are used instead.

A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver counsel display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may with use a rotary knob, touchpad, or extra rule method to show a non-touchscreen display. well-liked technologies afterward wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are resolved supplementary points.
</p>
<p>
The comfort, ergonomics, and general interior quality of the vehicle, as skillfully as the efficient use of space, are all taken into account subsequently determining the Comfort & Room score. Rear chair legroom measurement and comparison to the specified competitive set are with fixed points. A other narrowing is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the assist chair or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
The score for cargo spread and storage is clear by the reviewer's review of the vehicle's large and little cargo areas (as well as small-item storage), as without difficulty as how effectively they fulfill their expected functions and create efficient use of reachable space. Reviewers as a consequence agree to into account versatile loading features and creative storage solutions. Additionally, points are unmovable based on how the rear cargo hold or trunk's measurements relate to the agreed competitive set.
