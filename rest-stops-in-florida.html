A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver guidance display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may as well as use a rotary knob, touchpad, or new manage method to work a non-touchscreen display. well-liked technologies following wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are given additional points.
</p>
<p>

A bonus point is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the support seat or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
The score for cargo declare and storage is clear by the reviewer's evaluation of the vehicle's large and small cargo areas (as skillfully as small-item storage), as without difficulty as how effectively they fulfill their intended functions and make efficient use of affable space.
