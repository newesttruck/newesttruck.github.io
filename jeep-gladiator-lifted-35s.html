</p>
<p>
The Fuel Economy score is determined by comparing the estimated comprehensive mpg for every car in the lineup to the chosen competitive set. If there are no EPA figures available, the manufacturer's estimations of mpg are used instead. If the competitor set does not additionally give hybrid or PHEV models, hybrid and plug-in electric variations within a lineup that considerably lowers their total average will not be included in the comparison. Based on the comparative mile per gallon equivalent, or MPGe, and the kilowatts consumed per 100 miles, unlimited electric vehicles will be scored.
</p>

A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver instruction display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may next use a rotary knob, touchpad, or extra direct method to fake a non-touchscreen display. well-liked technologies gone wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are pure other points.
</p>
<p>
The comfort, ergonomics, and general interior setting of the vehicle, as well as the efficient use of space, are every taken into account in the manner of determining the Comfort & Room score. Rear seat legroom measurement and comparison to the specified competitive set are plus unlimited points. A bonus dwindling is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the help chair or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
The score for cargo broadcast and storage is clear by the reviewer's review of the vehicle's large and small cargo areas (as capably as small-item storage), as capably as how effectively they fulfill their expected functions and make efficient use of simple space. Reviewers as a consequence understand into account versatile loading features and creative storage solutions. Additionally, points are unchangeable based on how the rear cargo keep or trunk's measurements relate to the fixed competitive set.
