</p>
<p>
The Fuel Economy score is clear by comparing the estimated mass mpg for every car in the lineup to the prearranged competitive set. If there are no EPA figures available, the manufacturer's estimations of mpg are used instead. If the competitor set does not additionally manage to pay for hybrid or PHEV models, hybrid and plug-in electric variations within a lineup that considerably lowers their sum average will not be included in the comparison.

A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver guidance display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may afterward use a rotary knob, touchpad, or other rule method to play a part a non-touchscreen display. popular technologies gone wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are resolved supplementary points.
</p>
<p>

Rear seat legroom measurement and comparison to the specified competitive set are also truth points. A added narrowing is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the encourage chair or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
The score for cargo heavens and storage is clear by the reviewer's review of the vehicle's large and small cargo areas (as with ease as small-item storage), as competently as how effectively they fulfill their intended functions and make efficient use of welcoming space. Reviewers in addition to take on into account versatile loading features and creative storage solutions. Additionally, points are perfect based upon how the rear cargo withhold or trunk's measurements relate to the chosen competitive set.
