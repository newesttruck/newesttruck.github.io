</p>
<p>
The Fuel Economy score is distinct by comparing the estimated total mpg for all car in the lineup to the agreed competitive set. If there are no EPA figures available, the manufacturer's estimations of mpg are used instead. If the competitor set does not additionally have enough money hybrid or PHEV models, hybrid and plug-in electric variations within a lineup that considerably lowers their sum average will not be included in the comparison. Based upon the comparative mile per gallon equivalent, or MPGe, and the kilowatts consumed per 100 miles, resolved electric vehicles will be scored.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety wreck test data form the basis of the Safety score. Neither agency has nevertheless to rate a vehicle, hence it receives no points. Points given for specific cutting-edge driver-assistance safety technologies that arrive as within acceptable limits upon the lowest trim are moreover factored into the safety ranking.

</p>
<p>

A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver instruction display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may as well as use a rotary knob, touchpad, or extra control method to discharge duty a non-touchscreen display. popular technologies later than wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are fixed idea supplementary points.
</p>
<p>
The comfort, ergonomics, and general interior character of the vehicle, as without difficulty as the efficient use of space, are every taken into account past determining the Comfort & Room score. Rear chair legroom measurement and comparison to the specified competitive set are as well as unmodified points. A supplementary tapering off is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the put up to seat or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
The score for cargo aerate and storage is positive by the reviewer's evaluation of the vehicle's large and little cargo areas (as capably as small-item storage), as capably as how effectively they fulfill their intended functions and make efficient use of to hand space. Reviewers plus receive into account versatile loading features and creative storage solutions. Additionally, points are final based upon how the rear cargo keep or trunk's measurements relate to the fixed competitive set. A supplementary tapering off is awarded to vehicles in the same way as the best cargo or trunk look in their segment.
