A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver counsel display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may next use a rotary knob, touchpad, or supplementary govern method to play-act a non-touchscreen display. well-liked technologies bearing in mind wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are unqualified new points.

Rear seat legroom measurement and comparison to the specified competitive set are moreover unchangeable points. A extra point is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the urge on chair or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
The score for cargo ventilate and storage is certain by the reviewer's review of the vehicle's large and small cargo areas (as without difficulty as small-item storage), as without difficulty as how effectively they fulfill their meant functions and make efficient use of user-friendly space. Reviewers afterward acknowledge into account versatile loading features and creative storage solutions. Additionally, points are final based on how the rear cargo retain or trunk's measurements relate to the prearranged competitive set.
