A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver information display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may in addition to use a rotary knob, touchpad, or extra rule method to take effect a non-touchscreen display. popular technologies afterward wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are supreme supplementary points.
