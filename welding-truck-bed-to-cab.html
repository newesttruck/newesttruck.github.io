</p>
<p>
The Fuel Economy score is distinct by comparing the estimated cumulative mpg for every car in the lineup to the fixed competitive set. If there are no EPA figures available, the manufacturer's estimations of mpg are used instead.

A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver assistance display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may furthermore use a rotary knob, touchpad, or new direct method to play in a non-touchscreen display. well-liked technologies behind wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are final extra points.
</p>
<p>

A extra point is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the assist chair or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
The score for cargo look and storage is clear by the reviewer's evaluation of the vehicle's large and small cargo areas (as skillfully as small-item storage), as competently as how effectively they fulfill their expected functions and create efficient use of within reach space. Reviewers after that receive into account versatile loading features and creative storage solutions. Additionally, points are complete based upon how the rear cargo sustain or trunk's measurements relate to the fixed competitive set. A extra point is awarded to vehicles subsequent to the best cargo or trunk aerate in their segment.
