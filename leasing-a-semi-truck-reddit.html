                    <p align="justify">7 years, 8 months ago. A lease may cost you less up front, but if you don’t purchase the truck at the end of the lease, it can cost you more. In general, however, you should expect a truck payment to run you about $1,500 to $5,000+ per month. Typically lease advertisements don&#039;t include any of that and are priced.</p>

                    <p align="justify">Your payments are generally fixed and predictable, and there may be some tax advantages involved in leasing. Typically, trucks are priced at their cost per week. You need to do the business plan for your situation. These must be prepared and certified by a public accountant. Whatever you need to keep your company moving, ryder has it.</p>
