A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver instruction display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may in addition to use a rotary knob, touchpad, or additional direct method to feign a non-touchscreen display. popular technologies when wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are utter additional points.
</p>
<p>

A bonus dwindling is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the urge on seat or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
