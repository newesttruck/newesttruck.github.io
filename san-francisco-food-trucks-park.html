Premium vehicles may next use a rotary knob, touchpad, or further direct method to acquit yourself a non-touchscreen display. popular technologies following wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are definite supplementary points.
