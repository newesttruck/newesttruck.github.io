                    <p align="justify">The average tow truck driver in the united states makes $16.68 per hour. Tow truck drivers either own their own truck or work for a towing company. A flat tire, a jump start, or a locksmith if you’ve locked yourself out of your automobile are all examples of smaller jobs. That’s a small price to pay for all the help.</p>

                    <p align="justify">However, you should never feel obligated to tip a tow truck service person. They don&#039;t expect you to. No you dont have to tip aaa drivers and tow truck operators. This average varies based on location and whether the driver has a special commercial driver’s license (cdl). I love when i have a reaction to a reddit post and that.</p>

                    <p align="justify">Nov 15th, 2011 3:39 pm. Other tow truck drivers own their own vehicles are get paid per tow. They help get you and your incapacitated vehicle to safety—and that job comes with hazards. I’ve always tipped them $5 but figured since i wasn’t going for the tow and since it wasn’t like just changing a tire i’d give a bit.</p>

Tow truck drivers don’t get paid much. I was almost saying these exact words outloud. Of course, feel free to give more or less, depending on your ability to give.</p>
