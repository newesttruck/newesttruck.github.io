                    <p align="justify">This can be done using a rag and some soapy water. Gradually spread the paint along the panel. Now, add a small amount of thinned out primer into the spray gun and adjust the compressor for constant pressure. Spray lightly so the paint doesn&#039;t build up and run. David and kathy remodeled their lance 815 by painting the cabinets.</p>

Watch as will and otter washing and paint the tiny house aka 1972 caveman camper! Watch this week as my box camper erases its junkyard past with a new coat of paint. For one, you simply cannot paint your popup’s.</p>

                    <p align="justify">Once your primer is completely dry, go in with your camper paint. This can be done using a rag and some soapy water. Then after vacuuming up the dust, we used simple green to wash down all the surfaces. Before you can paint the fiberglass camper, ensure any interior or exterior damages are fixed first. This might be the correct.</p>

                    <p align="justify">For one, you simply cannot paint your popup’s canvas using just any type of paint. Grab a bucket of warm water and some cleaning solution to wash through the fiberglass exterior of your recreational vehicle. Clean and then rinse the surface. The proper way to paint an rv exterior involves removing decals, power washing, taping and covering windows and then.</p>

                    <p align="justify">Watch this week as my box camper erases its junkyard past with a new coat of paint. Add three coats of automotive clear to the camper shell. Trace firmly with a pencil. However, all the hard work is worth every drop of sweat. Between coats of paint, gently scuff the surface to allow for good adhesion.</p>
