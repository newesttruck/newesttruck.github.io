</p>
<p>
The score for cargo space and storage is definite by the reviewer's review of the vehicle's large and little cargo areas (as with ease as small-item storage), as with ease as how effectively they fulfill their meant functions and make efficient use of nearby space. Reviewers with tolerate into account versatile loading features and creative storage solutions. Additionally, points are unqualified based upon how the rear cargo hold or trunk's measurements relate to the agreed competitive set.
