A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver instruction display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may afterward use a rotary knob, touchpad, or further manage method to put it on a non-touchscreen display. well-liked technologies taking into consideration wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are resolution further points.
</p>
<p>
The comfort, ergonomics, and general interior vibes of the vehicle, as well as the efficient use of space, are every taken into account bearing in mind determining the Comfort & Room score. Rear chair legroom measurement and comparison to the specified competitive set are in addition to pure points. A added point is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the back up chair or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
