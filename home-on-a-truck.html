A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver information display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may as well as use a rotary knob, touchpad, or supplementary run method to be active a non-touchscreen display. well-liked technologies taking into account wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are unqualified supplementary points.

A supplementary tapering off is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the back up chair or in the third row, if one is available.
