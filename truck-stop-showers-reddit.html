Why can’t these truck stops put a 15min timer on the showers than they cut off i’ve been waiting over 30 minutes for a shower and only one has became.</p>

Pilot truck stops are taken care of and provide a clean, safe environment for anyone traveling and in need of a shower. Crossposted by 6 minutes ago. I suggest you go up to a driver and ask if they can help.</p>

                    <p align="justify">They also accumulate but go off your card after about a week. Since truckers utilize the facilities at truck stops because they’re specifically designed to meet their unique requirements, don’t be surprised when you’re told that a trucker has priority. Start date sep 15, 2020; Trucker showers are actually very clean and safe. There are two alternative methods to acquire.</p>

                    <p align="justify">Costs vary across the country for truck stop showers. Some stops offer free showers if you purchase a certain amount of fuel. You can accrue points on your bonus card, and instead of needing to spend 50 gallons of petrol to obtain a free shower, you may apply the points on your card. Log in or sign up to leave.</p>

Loves loves is another fantastic truck stop with the same commitment to truck stop shower quality as the others. Crossposted by 6 minutes ago. A team shower only costs the same if you have the points if you have to pay out of pocket you got to.</p>

                    <p align="justify">A normal shower under pressure will use an average of 2.5 gallons a minute so it’s best to approach an rv shower differently. While many people have seen the signs that point to the shower facilities, most assume they’re strictly for truck drivers. These showers are their lifeline to staying fresh. Their full time job is to drive long hours.</p>
