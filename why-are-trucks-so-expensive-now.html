The Fuel Economy score is definite by comparing the estimated combine mpg for every car in the lineup to the fixed competitive set. If there are no EPA figures available, the manufacturer's estimations of mpg are used instead. If the competitor set does not additionally pay for hybrid or PHEV models, hybrid and plug-in electric variations within a lineup that considerably lowers their total average will not be included in the comparison. Based on the comparative mile per gallon equivalent, or MPGe, and the kilowatts consumed per 100 miles, fixed electric vehicles will be scored.

A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver counsel display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may with use a rotary knob, touchpad, or extra run method to play a part a non-touchscreen display. well-liked technologies gone wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are unmovable additional points.
</p>
<p>
The comfort, ergonomics, and general interior atmosphere of the vehicle, as skillfully as the efficient use of space, are all taken into account next determining the Comfort & Room score. Rear chair legroom measurement and comparison to the specified competitive set are after that resolved points. A added tapering off is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the incite chair or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
The score for cargo sky and storage is certain by the reviewer's review of the vehicle's large and little cargo areas (as skillfully as small-item storage), as skillfully as how effectively they fulfill their intended functions and make efficient use of nearby space. Reviewers then consent into account versatile loading features and creative storage solutions. Additionally, points are supreme based upon how the rear cargo retain or trunk's measurements relate to the fixed competitive set.
