</p>
<p>
The score for cargo spread and storage is certain by the reviewer's review of the vehicle's large and small cargo areas (as without difficulty as small-item storage), as competently as how effectively they fulfill their meant functions and create efficient use of easily reached space. Reviewers with put up with into account versatile loading features and creative storage solutions. Additionally, points are conclusive based upon how the rear cargo maintain or trunk's measurements relate to the selected competitive set.
