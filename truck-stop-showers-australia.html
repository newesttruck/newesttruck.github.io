                    <p align="justify">You can accrue points on your bonus card, and instead of needing to spend 50 gallons of petrol to obtain a free shower, you may apply the points on your card. Fresh towels are provided at the major truck stops, but it wouldn’t hurt to carry your own towel if you think you’ll feel cleaner. Our truck stops offer facilities.</p>

                    <p align="justify">The truckers are often on a tight schedule. A truck stop shower has almost everything a basic bathroom contains, you’ll, of course, find the shower there. For the most part, they are very clean and professional. Plenty of room to fill up large trucks; Driver fatigue is the most common cause of road crashes involving heavy vehicles.</p>

                    <p align="justify">As you will find, there is often a line for showers at most truck stops. So even if there isn’t a time limit, and for most locations, there isn’t, be respectful and get in and out in an appropriate amount of time.

                    <p align="justify">Bring your own shower caddy with toiletries, or buy them at the truck stop before you go into the shower. The bathroom section will usually have a sink, toilet, blow dryer, mirror, fan, stole, hooks, and occasionally small mints to enjoy after your shower. Don’t spend too long inside. For the most part, they are very clean and professional. Here.</p>
