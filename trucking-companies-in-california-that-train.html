Premium vehicles may next use a rotary knob, touchpad, or extra govern method to sham a non-touchscreen display. popular technologies taking into consideration wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are given other points.

A added reduction is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the back up chair or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
