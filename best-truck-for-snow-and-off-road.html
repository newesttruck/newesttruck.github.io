                    <p align="justify">Get up to a $70 when you purchase a set of four new select cooper brand tires. The snow (whether light or heavy) will not deter the silverado from making any trip down icy roads. Trucks are still great candidates for driving across snowy roads, but there are some major weaknesses as you compare them to an equivalent suv. Awd.</p>

                    <p align="justify">To answer your question, i did a little homework. The short answer is that suvs are generally better in the snow. The dodge ram srt10 was built between 2004 and 2006 and most notably featured a huge 8.3l v10 making 500bhp. The ank mk38 has been and will be my go to offroad truck strictly for offroading. It seems odd.</p>
