    <h2>Overall: Columbus Taco Fest at Genoa Park</h2>
    <p>
A vehicle's handling, braking, acceleration, ride quality, and further qualitative play a role metrics including horsepower, torque, zero-to-60 time, and top eagerness are all evaluated subjectively to determine the behave score. The realization of trucks and SUVs to tow is in addition to taken into account. The vehicles' play is contrasted following the specified competitive set. afterward reviewing a vehicle though it is inborn driven, experts look for characteristics that are in descent in the same way as both consumer and manufacturer expectations.
</p>
<p>
The Fuel Economy score is definite by comparing the estimated total mpg for every car in the lineup to the agreed competitive set. If there are no EPA figures available, the manufacturer's estimations of mpg are used instead. If the competitor set does not additionally have the funds for hybrid or PHEV models, hybrid and plug-in electric variations within a lineup that considerably lowers their sum average will not be included in the comparison. Based on the comparative mile per gallon equivalent, or MPGe, and the kilowatts consumed per 100 miles, definite electric vehicles will be scored.
</p>
<p>
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety wreck exam data form the basis of the Safety score. Neither agency has yet to rate a vehicle, hence it receives no points. Points resolved for specific cutting-edge driver-assistance safety technologies that arrive as tolerable upon the lowest trim are along with factored into the safety ranking. Forbes Wheels believes that the in the manner of nine safety features must be included as allocation of the customary offering: pathway departure warning, forward emergency automatic braking, automatic tall beams, blind spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, adaptive cruise control, and one of its higher-level variants, lane keeping recommendation or alleyway centering.

Vehicles that have the funds for a Level 2 self-driving system, (a concentration of adaptive cruise run and pathway centering) are eligible for a further point.
</p>
<p>
Based on points conclusive for distinct elements included as pleasing equipment upon the base trim, the infotainment score is calculated. determined characteristics that are becoming more and more popular have been adopted by both premium and deposit push manufacturers, according to Forbes Wheels. A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver guidance display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may furthermore use a rotary knob, touchpad, or new rule method to put-on a non-touchscreen display. popular technologies taking into consideration wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are final other points.
</p>
<p>
The comfort, ergonomics, and general interior character of the vehicle, as without difficulty as the efficient use of space, are every taken into account once determining the Comfort & Room score. Rear seat legroom measurement and comparison to the specified competitive set are moreover perfect points. A other dwindling is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the support seat or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
The score for cargo proclaim and storage is determined by the reviewer's review of the vehicle's large and small cargo areas (as competently as small-item storage), as capably as how effectively they fulfill their expected functions and create efficient use of simple space. Reviewers then assume into account versatile loading features and creative storage solutions. Additionally, points are solution based on how the rear cargo hold or trunk's measurements relate to the agreed competitive set. A other reduction is awarded to vehicles once the best cargo or trunk publicize in their segment.
