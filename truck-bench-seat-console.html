    <h2>Overall: Outland 33101.04 Truck Bench Seat Console (Tan) eBay</h2>
    <p>

</p>
<p>
The Fuel Economy score is certain by comparing the estimated combination mpg for every car in the lineup to the fixed competitive set. If there are no EPA figures available, the manufacturer's estimations of mpg are used instead. If the competitor set does not additionally meet the expense of hybrid or PHEV models, hybrid and plug-in electric variations within a lineup that considerably lowers their total average will not be included in the comparison. Based on the comparative mile per gallon equivalent, or MPGe, and the kilowatts consumed per 100 miles, fixed idea electric vehicles will be scored.
</p>
<p>
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety smash test data form the basis of the Safety score. Neither agency has yet to rate a vehicle, thus it receives no points. Points truth for specific cutting-edge driver-assistance safety technologies that come as agreeable on the lowest trim are along with factored into the safety ranking. Forbes Wheels believes that the subsequently nine safety features must be included as allowance of the within acceptable limits offering: alleyway departure warning, concentrate on emergency automatic braking, automatic tall beams, blind spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, adaptive cruise control, and one of its higher-level variants, path keeping guidance or pathway centering.

</p>
<p>
Based upon points solution for certain elements included as good enough equipment on the base trim, the infotainment score is calculated. positive characteristics that are becoming more and more popular have been adopted by both premium and growth market manufacturers, according to Forbes Wheels. A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver assistance display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may next use a rotary knob, touchpad, or other control method to operate a non-touchscreen display. popular technologies taking into consideration wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are unmovable further points.
</p>
<p>

Rear seat legroom measurement and comparison to the specified competitive set are next pure points. A further reduction is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the incite chair or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
The score for cargo circulate and storage is clear by the reviewer's review of the vehicle's large and little cargo areas (as with ease as small-item storage), as capably as how effectively they fulfill their intended functions and make efficient use of available space. Reviewers as a consequence receive into account versatile loading features and creative storage solutions. Additionally, points are fixed idea based upon how the rear cargo hold or trunk's measurements relate to the chosen competitive set. A further tapering off is awarded to vehicles when the best cargo or trunk broadcast in their segment.
