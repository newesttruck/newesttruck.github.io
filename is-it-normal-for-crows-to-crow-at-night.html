                    <p align="justify">Yes, roosters crow at night. When they spot a predator like an owl or a snake, crows will caw to warn others about the danger and to drive the predator away. The screaming of crows is common during the day, but it is said that if the crow shouted at midnight, it would mean that something unfortunate is going to.</p>

                    <p align="justify">Roosters do most of their crowing at dawn and dusk. It’s bad luck to collect eggs from their nesting boxes after dark. Mainly, they make noises like this due to predators. They go to bed at dusk, same as parrots, and wake up at dawn. If a hen crows is means bad luck ( here’s proof that hens can crow).</p>

                    <p align="justify">Quick answer / by james core. The sound of another rooster in the night may also prompt a rooster to crow in the middle. There are a number of reasons why a crow may caw at night. Lets out 1 or 2 good crows around midnight or so then goes back to sleep untill 6am. The reason roosters rarely crow.</p>

                    <p align="justify">They wake up in the early morning and spend their day foraging with other members. With their cawing, they’re able to warn. A lot of nocturnal predators will prey on chickens in the night and the rooster’s crow may indicate he’s spotted a predator and is sounding the alarm. If the rooster does crow at night, any number of factors.</p>

                    <p align="justify">When a crow caws at you, you have to pay attention. Crows are diurnal, meaning they’re active throughout the day. The real issue lies in discerning the message from the crow. In the middle of the night, crow screaming is not a good sign. If the rooster does crow at night, any number of factors could be to blame.</p>

                    <p align="justify">Like most birds, crows sleep in trees. This can give the impression that the roosters are crowing at night. A lot of nocturnal predators will prey on chickens in the night and the rooster’s crow may indicate he’s spotted a predator and is sounding the alarm. The sound of another rooster in the night may also prompt a rooster to.</p>
