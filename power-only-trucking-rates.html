A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver opinion display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may as a consequence use a rotary knob, touchpad, or new direct method to performance a non-touchscreen display. well-liked technologies taking into consideration wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are answer extra points.

Rear seat legroom measurement and comparison to the specified competitive set are in addition to unchangeable points. A supplementary point is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the back up seat or in the third row, if one is available.
