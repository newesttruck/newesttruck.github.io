A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver recommendation display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may also use a rotary knob, touchpad, or new rule method to fake a non-touchscreen display. popular technologies subsequent to wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are given new points.

Rear seat legroom measurement and comparison to the specified competitive set are as well as pure points. A further lessening is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the encourage seat or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
