</p>
<p>
The Fuel Economy score is clear by comparing the estimated whole mpg for every car in the lineup to the fixed competitive set. If there are no EPA figures available, the manufacturer's estimations of mpg are used instead. If the competitor set does not additionally give hybrid or PHEV models, hybrid and plug-in electric variations within a lineup that considerably lowers their total average will not be included in the comparison.

A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver guidance display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may as a consequence use a rotary knob, touchpad, or extra rule method to comport yourself a non-touchscreen display. well-liked technologies in imitation of wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are complete new points.
</p>
<p>

A supplementary narrowing is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the assist chair or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
