Premium vehicles may also use a rotary knob, touchpad, or additional run method to affect a non-touchscreen display. well-liked technologies following wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are perfect new points.
