    <h2>Overall: Video Prerunner Silverado Shreds on Hoonigan Build Breakdown</h2>
    <p>
A vehicle's handling, braking, acceleration, ride quality, and extra qualitative accomplishment metrics including horsepower, torque, zero-to-60 time, and top rapidity are all evaluated subjectively to determine the work score. The triumph of trucks and SUVs to tow is moreover taken into account. The vehicles' proceed is contrasted like the specified competitive set. taking into consideration reviewing a vehicle even if it is monster driven, experts look for characteristics that are in heritage bearing in mind both consumer and manufacturer expectations.
</p>
<p>
The Fuel Economy score is distinct by comparing the estimated total mpg for all car in the lineup to the chosen competitive set. If there are no EPA figures available, the manufacturer's estimations of mpg are used instead. If the competitor set does not additionally give hybrid or PHEV models, hybrid and plug-in electric variations within a lineup that considerably lowers their sum average will not be included in the comparison. Based upon the comparative mile per gallon equivalent, or MPGe, and the kilowatts consumed per 100 miles, unqualified electric vehicles will be scored.
</p>
<p>
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety wreck test data form the basis of the Safety score. Neither agency has nevertheless to rate a vehicle, consequently it receives no points. Points resolved for specific cutting-edge driver-assistance safety technologies that arrive as adequate on the lowest trim are as a consequence factored into the safety ranking. Forbes Wheels believes that the similar to nine safety features must be included as share of the adequate offering: passage departure warning, adopt emergency automatic braking, automatic tall beams, blind spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, adaptive cruise control, and one of its higher-level variants, passage keeping instruction or passageway centering. For vehicles to gain points, they must supplement at least four of them in their regular offering. Vehicles that pay for a Level 2 self-driving system, (a captivation of adaptive cruise manage and passage centering) are eligible for a bonus point.
</p>
<p>
Based on points conclusive for definite elements included as gratifying equipment on the base trim, the infotainment score is calculated. certain characteristics that are becoming more and more popular have been adopted by both premium and accumulation publicize manufacturers, according to Forbes Wheels. A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver instruction display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may plus use a rotary knob, touchpad, or further control method to action a non-touchscreen display. popular technologies next wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are definite new points.
</p>
<p>
The comfort, ergonomics, and general interior air of the vehicle, as skillfully as the efficient use of space, are all taken into account like determining the Comfort & Room score. Rear seat legroom measurement and comparison to the specified competitive set are as well as given points. A other point is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the help chair or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
The score for cargo impression and storage is distinct by the reviewer's review of the vehicle's large and small cargo areas (as skillfully as small-item storage), as competently as how effectively they fulfill their expected functions and create efficient use of straightforward space. Reviewers furthermore bow to into account versatile loading features and creative storage solutions. Additionally, points are utter based upon how the rear cargo withhold or trunk's measurements relate to the prearranged competitive set. A other narrowing is awarded to vehicles when the best cargo or trunk way of being in their segment.
