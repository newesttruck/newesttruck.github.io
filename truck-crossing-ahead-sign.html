    <p>
A vehicle's handling, braking, acceleration, ride quality, and new qualitative con metrics including horsepower, torque, zero-to-60 time, and top swiftness are all evaluated subjectively to determine the affect score.

If there are no EPA figures available, the manufacturer's estimations of mpg are used instead. If the competitor set does not additionally have the funds for hybrid or PHEV models, hybrid and plug-in electric variations within a lineup that considerably lowers their total average will not be included in the comparison. Based on the comparative mile per gallon equivalent, or MPGe, and the kilowatts consumed per 100 miles, unmovable electric vehicles will be scored.
</p>
<p>
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety smash test data form the basis of the Safety score. Neither agency has yet to rate a vehicle, thus it receives no points.

A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver counsel display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may along with use a rotary knob, touchpad, or additional govern method to decree a non-touchscreen display. popular technologies similar to wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are truth other points.
</p>
<p>

Rear chair legroom measurement and comparison to the specified competitive set are after that given points. A bonus dwindling is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the help seat or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
The score for cargo express and storage is certain by the reviewer's review of the vehicle's large and small cargo areas (as capably as small-item storage), as without difficulty as how effectively they fulfill their expected functions and create efficient use of easy to use space. Reviewers after that undertake into account versatile loading features and creative storage solutions. Additionally, points are solution based upon how the rear cargo retain or trunk's measurements relate to the fixed competitive set. A other lessening is awarded to vehicles as soon as the best cargo or trunk announce in their segment.
</p>
<p>
The Styling score is a judgment of a vehicle's overall interior and exterior styling and design. Reviewers also take into account how the interior is organized and how well the design supports the purpose. A factor is the build quality.</p>
