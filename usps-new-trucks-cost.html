<p>
The Fuel Economy score is certain by comparing the estimated amassed mpg for all car in the lineup to the fixed competitive set. If there are no EPA figures available, the manufacturer's estimations of mpg are used instead.

A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver information display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may then use a rotary knob, touchpad, or further run method to produce a result a non-touchscreen display. well-liked technologies taking into account wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are unmodified new points.
</p>
<p>
