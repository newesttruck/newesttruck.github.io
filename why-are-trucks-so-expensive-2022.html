The Fuel Economy score is positive by comparing the estimated total mpg for all car in the lineup to the fixed competitive set. If there are no EPA figures available, the manufacturer's estimations of mpg are used instead. If the competitor set does not additionally manage to pay for hybrid or PHEV models, hybrid and plug-in electric variations within a lineup that considerably lowers their sum average will not be included in the comparison. Based on the comparative mile per gallon equivalent, or MPGe, and the kilowatts consumed per 100 miles, fixed idea electric vehicles will be scored.
</p>
<p>
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety smash test data form the basis of the Safety score. Neither agency has yet to rate a vehicle, fittingly it receives no points.

A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver suggestion display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may moreover use a rotary knob, touchpad, or further manage method to perform a non-touchscreen display. popular technologies bearing in mind wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are unchangeable supplementary points.
</p>
<p>
The comfort, ergonomics, and general interior feel of the vehicle, as skillfully as the efficient use of space, are all taken into account like determining the Comfort & Room score. Rear chair legroom measurement and comparison to the specified competitive set are in addition to answer points. A added reduction is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the encourage chair or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
The score for cargo tune and storage is certain by the reviewer's evaluation of the vehicle's large and little cargo areas (as capably as small-item storage), as skillfully as how effectively they fulfill their expected functions and make efficient use of genial space. Reviewers afterward take into account versatile loading features and creative storage solutions. Additionally, points are conclusive based upon how the rear cargo support or trunk's measurements relate to the prearranged competitive set.
