A added dwindling is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the encourage seat or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
The score for cargo impression and storage is determined by the reviewer's review of the vehicle's large and little cargo areas (as with ease as small-item storage), as with ease as how effectively they fulfill their intended functions and create efficient use of within reach space.
