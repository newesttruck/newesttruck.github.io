    <p>
A vehicle's handling, braking, acceleration, ride quality, and new qualitative produce an effect metrics including horsepower, torque, zero-to-60 time, and top keenness are all evaluated subjectively to determine the acquit yourself score. The feat of trucks and SUVs to tow is as well as taken into account. The vehicles' enactment is contrasted in the manner of the specified competitive set. when reviewing a vehicle even though it is bodily driven, experts see for characteristics that are in lineage following both consumer and manufacturer expectations.
</p>
<p>

If there are no EPA figures available, the manufacturer's estimations of mpg are used instead. If the competitor set does not additionally meet the expense of hybrid or PHEV models, hybrid and plug-in electric variations within a lineup that considerably lowers their sum average will not be included in the comparison. Based on the comparative mile per gallon equivalent, or MPGe, and the kilowatts consumed per 100 miles, utter electric vehicles will be scored.

Rear chair legroom measurement and comparison to the specified competitive set are plus pure points. A further dwindling is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the assist chair or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
