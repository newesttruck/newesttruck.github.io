Rear chair legroom measurement and comparison to the specified competitive set are also solution points. A supplementary lessening is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the incite chair or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
The score for cargo way of being and storage is positive by the reviewer's review of the vehicle's large and little cargo areas (as without difficulty as small-item storage), as skillfully as how effectively they fulfill their expected functions and create efficient use of simple space. Reviewers then bow to into account versatile loading features and creative storage solutions.
