Truck buyers haven’t backed off, so prices continue climbing. I am 63.</p>

                    <p align="justify">The price of used cars is revving up even faster than new cars, and experts are sounding the alarm. When it was new, the window sticker price on a typical 2019 toyota tacoma sr double cab pickup was just under $29,000. I’ve driven trucks from every decade from the 50’s to my latest a 2015. A used model is significantly.</p>

Used trucks are more expensive now than they have been in the past as more people need trucks to either help them do their job or help with their family responsibilities.

                    <p align="justify">Truck buyers haven’t backed off, so prices continue climbing. Used trucks cost so much because they are often more durable than newer models, have a wider selection of versatile options, and because newer trucks are even more expensive than used trucks. Granted, since trucks and suvs are in high demand right now, the prices will be slightly higher than when.</p>

                    <p align="justify">Why are used pickup trucks so expensive? First, supply chain shortages have forced manufacturers to produce fewer new cars, driving up the cost and discouraging people (many of which are suffering from financial hardships) from buying new vehicles. They have evolved from a plain jane utility vehicle. The outlet recently put out a list of 16 vehicles that cost more.</p>
