</p>
<p>
The Fuel Economy score is clear by comparing the estimated combination mpg for every car in the lineup to the chosen competitive set. If there are no EPA figures available, the manufacturer's estimations of mpg are used instead.

A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver assistance display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may next use a rotary knob, touchpad, or supplementary direct method to conduct yourself a non-touchscreen display. well-liked technologies afterward wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are firm other points.
</p>
<p>
