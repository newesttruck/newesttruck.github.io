    <h2>Overall: 2016 Ford F150 XLT Blackout Build VIP Auto Accessories Blog</h2>
    <p>
A vehicle's handling, braking, acceleration, ride quality, and extra qualitative undertaking metrics including horsepower, torque, zero-to-60 time, and top readiness are every evaluated subjectively to determine the accomplish score. The expertise of trucks and SUVs to tow is moreover taken into account. The vehicles' doing is contrasted later than the specified competitive set. subsequent to reviewing a vehicle even though it is living thing driven, experts see for characteristics that are in pedigree later than both consumer and manufacturer expectations.
</p>
<p>
The Fuel Economy score is definite by comparing the estimated combined mpg for every car in the lineup to the selected competitive set. If there are no EPA figures available, the manufacturer's estimations of mpg are used instead. If the competitor set does not additionally meet the expense of hybrid or PHEV models, hybrid and plug-in electric variations within a lineup that considerably lowers their sum average will not be included in the comparison. Based upon the comparative mile per gallon equivalent, or MPGe, and the kilowatts consumed per 100 miles, perfect electric vehicles will be scored.
</p>
<p>
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety smash test data form the basis of the Safety score. Neither agency has nevertheless to rate a vehicle, thus it receives no points. Points fixed idea for specific cutting-edge driver-assistance safety technologies that come as all right on the lowest trim are then factored into the safety ranking. Forbes Wheels believes that the next nine safety features must be included as part of the all right offering: pathway departure warning, concentrate on emergency automatic braking, automatic tall beams, blind spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, adaptive cruise control, and one of its higher-level variants, alleyway keeping guidance or lane centering.

</p>
<p>

A minimum 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver counsel display or instrument panel, and at least 2 USB ports are some of these features. Premium vehicles may as a consequence use a rotary knob, touchpad, or other manage method to proceed a non-touchscreen display. well-liked technologies like wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless charging capabilities that haven't been widely adopted in mainstream automobiles are answer other points.
</p>
<p>
The comfort, ergonomics, and general interior tone of the vehicle, as competently as the efficient use of space, are every taken into account taking into consideration determining the Comfort & Room score. Rear seat legroom measurement and comparison to the specified competitive set are with firm points. A extra reduction is awarded to vehicles that have the best legroom in their segment in the back chair or in the third row, if one is available.
</p>
<p>
The score for cargo tune and storage is determined by the reviewer's evaluation of the vehicle's large and small cargo areas (as skillfully as small-item storage), as with ease as how effectively they fulfill their intended functions and create efficient use of clear space. Reviewers plus put up with into account versatile loading features and creative storage solutions. Additionally, points are unmodified based on how the rear cargo preserve or trunk's measurements relate to the fixed competitive set. A added reduction is awarded to vehicles later the best cargo or trunk sky in their segment.
